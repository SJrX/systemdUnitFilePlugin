<p>This option may be used more than once, or a space-separated list of unit names may
        be given. A symbolic link is created in the .wants/ or
        .requires/ directory of each of the listed units when this unit is installed by
        systemctl enable. This has the effect of a dependency of type
        <var>Wants=</var> or <var>Requires=</var> being added from the listed unit to the
        current unit. The primary result is that the current unit will be started when the listed unit is
        started, see the description of <var>Wants=</var> and <var>Requires=</var> in the
        [Unit] section for details.</p>
<p>In case of template units listing non template units, the listing unit must have
        <var>DefaultInstance=</var> set, or systemctl enable must be called with
        an instance name. The instance (default or specified) will be added to the
        .wants/ or .requires/ list of the listed unit. For example,
        WantedBy=getty.target in a service getty@.service will result
        in systemctl enable getty@tty2.service creating a
        getty.target.wants/getty@tty2.service link to
        getty@.service. This also applies to listing specific instances of templated
        units: this specific instance will gain the dependency. A template unit may also list a template
        unit, in which case a generic dependency will be added where each instance of the listing unit will
        have a dependency on an instance of the listed template with the same instance value. For example,
        WantedBy=container@.target in a service monitor@.service will
        result in systemctl enable monitor@.service creating a
        container@.target.wants/monitor@.service link to
        monitor@.service, which applies to all instances of
        container@.target.</p>
