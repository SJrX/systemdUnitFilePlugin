<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, the time when the service unit was last triggered
        is stored on disk.  When the timer is activated, the service unit is triggered immediately if it
        would have been triggered at least once during the time when the timer was inactive. Such triggering
        is nonetheless subject to the delay imposed by <var>RandomizedDelaySec=</var>.
        This is useful to catch up on missed runs of the service when the system was powered down. Note that
        this setting only has an effect on timers configured with <var>OnCalendar=</var>. Defaults to
        <var>false</var>.</p>
<p>Use systemctl clean --what=state â€¦ on the timer unit to remove the timestamp
        file maintained by this option from disk. In particular, use this command before uninstalling a timer
        unit. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)
    </a> for
        details.</p>
