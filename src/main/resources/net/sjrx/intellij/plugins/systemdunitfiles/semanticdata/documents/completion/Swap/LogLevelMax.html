<p>Configures filtering by log level of log messages generated by this unit. Takes a
        syslog log level, one of <var>emerg</var> (lowest log level, only highest priority
        messages), <var>alert</var>, <var>crit</var>, <var>err</var>, <var>warning</var>,
        <var>notice</var>, <var>info</var>, <var>debug</var> (highest log level, also lowest priority
        messages). See <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)
    </a> for
        details. By default no filtering is applied (i.e. the default maximum log level is <var>debug</var>). Use
        this option to configure the logging system to drop log messages of a specific service above the specified
        level. For example, set <var>LogLevelMax=</var><var>info</var> in order to turn off debug logging
        of a particularly chatty unit. Note that the configured level is applied to any log messages written by any
        of the processes belonging to this unit, as well as any log messages written by the system manager process
        (PID 1) in reference to this unit, sent via any supported logging protocol. The filtering is applied
        early in the logging pipeline, before any kind of further processing is done. Moreover, messages which pass
        through this filter successfully might still be dropped by filters applied at a later stage in the logging
        subsystem. For example, <var>MaxLevelStore=</var> configured in
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/journald.conf.5.html">journald.conf(5)
    </a> might
        prohibit messages of higher log levels to be stored on disk, even though the per-unit
        <var>LogLevelMax=</var> permitted it to be processed.</p>
