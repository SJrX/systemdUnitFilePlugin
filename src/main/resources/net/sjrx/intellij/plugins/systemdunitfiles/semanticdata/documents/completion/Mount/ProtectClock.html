<p>Takes a boolean argument. If set, writes to the hardware clock or system clock will be denied.
        It is recommended to turn this on for most services that do not need modify the clock. Defaults to off. Enabling
        this option removes CAP_SYS_TIME and CAP_WAKE_ALARM from the
        capability bounding set for this unit, installs a system call filter to block calls that can set the
        clock, and <var>DeviceAllow=char-rtc r</var> is implied. This ensures /dev/rtc0,
        /dev/rtc1, etc. are made read-only to the service. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control(5)
    </a>
        for the details about <var>DeviceAllow=</var>. If this setting is on, but the unit
        doesn't have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. services for which
        <var>User=</var> is set), <var>NoNewPrivileges=yes</var> is implied.</p>
