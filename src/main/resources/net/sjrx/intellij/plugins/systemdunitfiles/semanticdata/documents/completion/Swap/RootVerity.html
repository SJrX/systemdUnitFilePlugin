<p>Takes the path to a data integrity (dm-verity) file. This option enables data integrity checks
        using dm-verity, if <var>RootImage=</var> is used and a root-hash is passed and if the used image itself
        does not contains the integrity data. The integrity data must be matched by the root hash. If this option is not
        specified, but a file with the .verity suffix is found next to the image file, bearing otherwise
        the same name (except if the image has the .raw suffix, in which case the verity data file must
        not have it in its name), the verity data is read from it and automatically used.</p>
<p>This option is supported only for disk images that contain a single file system, without an
        enveloping partition table. Images that contain a GPT partition table should instead include both
        root file system and matching Verity data in the same image, implementing the <a href="https://systemd.io/DISCOVERABLE_PARTITIONS">Discoverable Partitions Specification</a>.</p>
