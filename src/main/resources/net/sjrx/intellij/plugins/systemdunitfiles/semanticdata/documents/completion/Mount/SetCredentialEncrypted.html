<p>The <var>SetCredential=</var> setting is similar to
        <var>LoadCredential=</var> but accepts a literal value to use as data for the credential,
        instead of a file system path to read the data from. Do not use this option for data that is supposed
        to be secret, as it is accessible to unprivileged processes via IPC. It's only safe to use this for
        user IDs, public key material and similar non-sensitive data. For everything else use
        <var>LoadCredential=</var>. In order to embed binary data into the credential data use
        C-style escaping (i.e. \n to embed a newline, or \x00 to embed
        a NUL byte).</p>
<p>The <var>SetCredentialEncrypted=</var> setting is identical to
        <var>SetCredential=</var> but expects an encrypted credential in literal form as value. This
        allows embedding confidential credentials securely directly in unit files. Use
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-creds.1.html">systemd-creds(1)
    </a>'
        <var>-p</var> switch to generate suitable <var>SetCredentialEncrypted=</var> lines
        directly from plaintext credentials. For further details see
        <var>LoadCredentialEncrypted=</var> above.</p>
<p>If a credential of the same ID is listed in both <var>LoadCredential=</var> and
        <var>SetCredential=</var>, the latter will act as default if the former cannot be
        retrieved. In this case not being able to retrieve the credential from the path specified in
        <var>LoadCredential=</var> is not considered fatal.</p>
