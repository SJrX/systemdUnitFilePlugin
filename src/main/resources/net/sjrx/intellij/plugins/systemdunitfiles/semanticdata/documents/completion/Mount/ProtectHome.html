<p>Takes a boolean argument or the special values read-only or
        tmpfs. If true, the directories /home/,
        /root, and /run/user are made inaccessible and empty for
        processes invoked by this unit. If set to read-only, the three directories are
        made read-only instead. If set to tmpfs, temporary file systems are mounted on the
        three directories in read-only mode. The value tmpfs is useful to hide home
        directories not relevant to the processes invoked by the unit, while still allowing necessary
        directories to be made visible when listed in <var>BindPaths=</var> or
        <var>BindReadOnlyPaths=</var>.</p>
<p>Setting this to yes is mostly equivalent to setting the three directories in
        <var>InaccessiblePaths=</var>. Similarly, read-only is mostly equivalent to
        <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var>, and tmpfs is mostly equivalent to
        <var>TemporaryFileSystem=</var> with :ro.</p>
<p>It is recommended to enable this setting for all long-running services (in particular
        network-facing ones), to ensure they cannot get access to private user data, unless the services
        actually require access to the user's private data. This setting is implied if
        <var>DynamicUser=</var> is set. This setting cannot ensure protection in all cases. In
        general it has the same limitations as <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var>, see below.</p>
