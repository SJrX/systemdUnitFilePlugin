<p>Similar to the <var>ConditionArchitecture=</var>,
          <var>ConditionVirtualization=</var>, â€¦, condition settings described above, these settings
          add assertion checks to the start-up of the unit. However, unlike the conditions settings, any
          assertion setting that is not met results in failure of the start job (which means this is logged
          loudly). Note that hitting a configured assertion does not cause the unit to enter the
          failed state (or in fact result in any state change of the unit), it affects
          only the job queued for it. Use assertion expressions for units that cannot operate when specific
          requirements are not met, and when this is something the administrator or user should look
          into.</p>
