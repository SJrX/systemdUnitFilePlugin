<p>Takes a boolean argument. If
        <var>true</var>, this unit can only be activated or
        deactivated indirectly. In this case, explicit start-up or
        termination requested by the user is denied, however if it is
        started or stopped as a dependency of another unit, start-up
        or termination will succeed. This is mostly a safety feature
        to ensure that the user does not accidentally activate units
        that are not intended to be activated explicitly, and not
        accidentally deactivate units that are not intended to be
        deactivated. These options default to
        <var>false</var>.</p>
