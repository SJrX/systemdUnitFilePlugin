<p>The unit to activate when this timer elapses.
        The argument is a unit name, whose suffix is not
        .timer. If not specified, this value
        defaults to a service that has the same name as the timer
        unit, except for the suffix. (See above.) It is recommended
        that the unit name that is activated and the unit name of the
        timer unit are named identically, except for the
        suffix.</p>
