<p>Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit(2)
    </a> for
        details on the process resource limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats:
        either as single value to set a specific soft and hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated
        pair <var>soft:hard</var> to set both limits individually
        (e.g. LimitAS=4G:16G).  Use the string <var>infinity</var> to configure no
        limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the base 1024) may
        be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. LimitAS=16G). For the limits
        referring to time values, the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)
    </a> for
        details). Note that if no time unit is specified for <var>LimitCPU=</var> the default unit of
        seconds is implied, while for <var>LimitRTTIME=</var> the default unit of microseconds is
        implied. Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their
        enforcement. For example, time limits specified for <var>LimitCPU=</var> will be rounded up
        implicitly to multiples of 1s. For <var>LimitNICE=</var> the value may be specified in two
        syntaxes: if prefixed with + or -, the value is understood as
        regular Linux nice value in the range -20…19. If not prefixed like this the value is understood as
        raw resource limit parameter in the range 0…40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).</p>
<p>Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and
        processes may fork in order to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the
        original process, and may thus escape limits set. Also note that <var>LimitRSS=</var> is not
        implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource
        controls listed in
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control(5)
    </a>
        over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may be altered dynamically at
        runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, <var>MemoryMax=</var> is a more
        powerful (and working) replacement for <var>LimitRSS=</var>.</p>
<p>Note that <var>LimitNPROC=</var> will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and
        not the number of processes started (forked) by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all
        processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the <var>LimitNPROC=</var> will not be
        enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations,
        <var>TasksMax=</var> (see <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control(5)
    </a>) is typically a better choice than <var>LimitNPROC=</var>.
        </p>
<p>Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various
        <var>DefaultLimitCPU=</var>, <var>DefaultLimitFSIZE=</var>, … options available in
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf(5)
    </a>, and –
        if not configured there – the kernel or per-user defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user
        services, see below).</p>
<p>For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured
        in a user service (i.e. a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be
        used to raise the limits above those set for the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as
        the user's service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so. In user context these
        configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit
        to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the
        available configuration mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require
        privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by
        setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's service manager, i.e. the user's
        instance of user@.service. After making such changes, make sure to restart the
        user's service manager.</p>
