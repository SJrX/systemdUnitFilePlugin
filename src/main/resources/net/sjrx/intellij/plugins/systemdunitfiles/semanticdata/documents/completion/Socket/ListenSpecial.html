<p>Specifies a special file in the file system to
        listen on. This expects an absolute file system path as
        argument. Behavior otherwise is very similar to the
        <var>ListenFIFO=</var> directive above. Use this to
        open character device nodes as well as special files in
        /proc/ and
        /sys/.</p>
