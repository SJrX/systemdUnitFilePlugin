<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, a timer will stay loaded, and its state remains
        queryable even after it elapsed and the associated unit (as configured with <var>Unit=</var>,
        see above) deactivated again. If false, an elapsed timer unit that cannot elapse anymore is unloaded
        once its associated unit deactivated again. Turning this off is particularly useful for transient
        timer units. Note that this setting has an effect when repeatedly starting a timer unit: if
        <var>RemainAfterElapse=</var> is on, starting the timer a second time has no effect. However,
        if <var>RemainAfterElapse=</var> is off and the timer unit was already unloaded, it can be
        started again, and thus the service can be triggered multiple times. Defaults to
        <var>true</var>.</p>
