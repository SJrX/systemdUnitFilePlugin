<p>The unit to activate when any of the
        configured paths changes. The argument is a unit name, whose
        suffix is not .path. If not specified, this
        value defaults to a service that has the same name as the path
        unit, except for the suffix. (See above.) It is recommended
        that the unit name that is activated and the unit name of the
        path unit are named identical, except for the
        suffix.</p>
