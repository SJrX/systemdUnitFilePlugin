<p><var>ConditionEnvironment=</var> may be used to check whether a specific
          environment variable is set (or if prefixed with the exclamation mark â€” unset) in the service
          manager's environment block.

          The argument may be a single word, to check if the variable with this name is defined in the
          environment block, or an assignment
          (name=value), to check if
          the variable with this exact value is defined. Note that the environment block of the service
          manager itself is checked, i.e. not any variables defined with <var>Environment=</var> or
          <var>EnvironmentFile=</var>, as described above. This is particularly useful when the
          service manager runs inside a containerized environment or as per-user service manager, in order to
          check for variables passed in by the enclosing container manager or PAM.</p>
