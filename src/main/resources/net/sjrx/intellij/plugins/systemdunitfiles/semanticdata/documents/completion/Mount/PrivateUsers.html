<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, sets up a new user namespace for the executed processes and
        configures a minimal user and group mapping, that maps the root user and group as well as
        the unit's own user and group to themselves and everything else to the nobody user and
        group. This is useful to securely detach the user and group databases used by the unit from the rest of the
        system, and thus to create an effective sandbox environment. All files, directories, processes, IPC objects and
        other resources owned by users/groups not equaling root or the unit's own will stay visible
        from within the unit but appear owned by the nobody user and group. If this mode is enabled,
        all unit processes are run without privileges in the host user namespace (regardless if the unit's own
        user/group is root or not). Specifically this means that the process will have zero process
        capabilities on the host's user namespace, but full capabilities within the service's user namespace. Settings
        such as <var>CapabilityBoundingSet=</var> will affect only the latter, and there's no way to acquire
        additional capabilities in the host's user namespace. Defaults to off.</p>
<p>When this setting is set up by a per-user instance of the service manager, the mapping of the
        root user and group to itself is omitted (unless the user manager is root).
        Additionally, in the per-user instance manager case, the
        user namespace will be set up before most other namespaces. This means that combining
        <var>PrivateUsers=</var><var>true</var> with other namespaces will enable use of features not
        normally supported by the per-user instances of the service manager.</p>
<p>This setting is particularly useful in conjunction with
        <var>RootDirectory=</var>/<var>RootImage=</var>, as the need to synchronize the user and group
        databases in the root directory and on the host is reduced, as the only users and groups who need to be matched
        are root, nobody and the unit's own user and group.</p>
<p>Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if user namespaces are not
        available), and the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely on this setting for
        security.</p>
