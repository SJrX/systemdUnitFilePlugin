<p>Specifies whether to send
        SIGKILL (or the signal specified by
        <var>FinalKillSignal=</var>) to remaining processes
        after a timeout, if the normal shutdown procedure left
        processes of the service around. When disabled, a
        <var>KillMode=</var> of control-group
        or mixed service will not restart if
        processes from prior services exist within the control group.
        Takes a boolean value. Defaults to "yes".
