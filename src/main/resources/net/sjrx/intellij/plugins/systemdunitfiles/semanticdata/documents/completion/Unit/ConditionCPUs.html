<p>Verify that the specified number of CPUs is available to the current system. Takes
          a number of CPUs as argument, optionally prefixed with a comparison operator
          &lt;, &lt;=, = (or ==),
          != (or &lt;&gt;), &gt;=,
          &gt;. Compares the number of CPUs in the CPU affinity mask configured of the
          service manager itself with the specified number, adhering to the specified comparison operator. On
          physical systems the number of CPUs in the affinity mask of the service manager usually matches the
          number of physical CPUs, but in special and virtual environments might differ. In particular, in
          containers the affinity mask usually matches the number of CPUs assigned to the container and not
          the physically available ones.</p>
