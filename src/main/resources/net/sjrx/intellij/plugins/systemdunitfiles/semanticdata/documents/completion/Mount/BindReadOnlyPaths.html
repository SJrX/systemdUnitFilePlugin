<p>Configures unit-specific bind mounts. A bind mount makes a particular file or directory
        available at an additional place in the unit's view of the file system. Any bind mounts created with this
        option are specific to the unit, and are not visible in the host's mount table. This option expects a
        whitespace separated list of bind mount definitions. Each definition consists of a colon-separated triple of
        source path, destination path and option string, where the latter two are optional. If only a source path is
        specified the source and destination is taken to be the same. The option string may be either
        rbind or norbind for configuring a recursive or non-recursive bind
        mount. If the destination path is omitted, the option string must be omitted too.
        Each bind mount definition may be prefixed with -, in which case it will be ignored
        when its source path does not exist.</p>
<p><var>BindPaths=</var> creates regular writable bind mounts (unless the source file system mount
        is already marked read-only), while <var>BindReadOnlyPaths=</var> creates read-only bind mounts. These
        settings may be used more than once, each usage appends to the unit's list of bind mounts. If the empty string
        is assigned to either of these two options the entire list of bind mounts defined prior to this is reset. Note
        that in this case both read-only and regular bind mounts are reset, regardless which of the two settings is
        used.</p>
<p>This option is particularly useful when <var>RootDirectory=</var>/<var>RootImage=</var>
        is used. In this case the source path refers to a path on the host file system, while the destination path
        refers to a path below the root directory of the unit.</p>
<p>Note that the destination directory must exist or systemd must be able to create it. Thus, it
        is not possible to use those options for mount points nested underneath paths specified in
        <var>InaccessiblePaths=</var>, or under /home/ and other protected
        directories if <var>ProtectHome=yes</var> is
        specified. <var>TemporaryFileSystem=</var> with :ro or
        <var>ProtectHome=tmpfs</var> should be used instead.</p>
