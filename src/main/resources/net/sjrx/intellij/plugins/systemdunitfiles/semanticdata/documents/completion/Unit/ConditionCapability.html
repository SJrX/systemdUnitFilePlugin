<p>Check whether the given capability exists in the capability bounding set of the
          service manager (i.e. this does not check whether capability is actually available in the permitted
          or effective sets, see
          <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)
    </a>
          for details). Pass a capability name such as CAP_MKNOD, possibly prefixed with
          an exclamation mark to negate the check.</p>
