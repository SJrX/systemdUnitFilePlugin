<p>Turn on process and kernel memory accounting for this
          unit. Takes a boolean argument. Note that turning on memory
          accounting for one unit will also implicitly turn it on for
          all units contained in the same slice and for all its parent
          slices and the units contained therein. The system default
          for this setting may be controlled with
          <var>DefaultMemoryAccounting=</var> in
          <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf(5)
    </a>.</p>
