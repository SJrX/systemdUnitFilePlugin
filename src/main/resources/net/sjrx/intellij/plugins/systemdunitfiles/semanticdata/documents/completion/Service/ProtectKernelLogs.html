<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, access to the kernel log ring buffer will be denied. It is
        recommended to turn this on for most services that do not need to read from or write to the kernel log ring
        buffer. Enabling this option removes CAP_SYSLOG from the capability bounding set for this
        unit, and installs a system call filter to block the
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syslog.2.html">syslog(2)
    </a>
        system call (not to be confused with the libc API
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)
    </a>
        for userspace logging). The kernel exposes its log buffer to userspace via /dev/kmsg and
        /proc/kmsg. If enabled, these are made inaccessible to all the processes in the unit.
        If this setting is on, but the unit doesn't have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
        capability (e.g. services for which <var>User=</var> is set),
        <var>NoNewPrivileges=yes</var> is implied.</p>
