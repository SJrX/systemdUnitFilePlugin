<p>Configures the time to wait for the mount
        command to finish. If a command does not exit within the
        configured time, the mount will be considered failed and be
        shut down again. All commands still running will be terminated
        forcibly via SIGTERM, and after another
        delay of this time with SIGKILL. (See
        <var>KillMode=</var> in
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.kill.5.html">systemd.kill(5)
    </a>.)
        Takes a unit-less value in seconds, or a time span value such
        as "5min 20s". Pass 0 to disable the timeout logic. The
        default value is set from <var>DefaultTimeoutStartSec=</var> option in
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf(5)
    </a>.
