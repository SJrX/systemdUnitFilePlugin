<p>The name of the slice unit to place the unit
          in. Defaults to system.slice for all
          non-instantiated units of all unit types (except for slice
          units themselves see below). Instance units are by default
          placed in a subslice of system.slice
          that is named after the template name.</p>
<p>This option may be used to arrange systemd units in a
          hierarchy of slices each of which might have resource
          settings applied.</p>
<p>For units of type slice, the only accepted value for
          this setting is the parent slice. Since the name of a slice
          unit implies the parent slice, it is hence redundant to ever
          set this parameter directly for slice units.</p>
<p>Special care should be taken when relying on the default slice assignment in templated service units
          that have <var>DefaultDependencies=no</var> set, see
          <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)
    </a>, section
          "Default Dependencies" for details.</p>
