<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, detach the
        filesystem from the filesystem hierarchy at time of the unmount
        operation, and clean up all references to the filesystem as
        soon as they are not busy anymore.
        This corresponds with
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/umount.8.html">umount(8)
    </a>'s
        -l switch. Defaults to
        off.</p>
