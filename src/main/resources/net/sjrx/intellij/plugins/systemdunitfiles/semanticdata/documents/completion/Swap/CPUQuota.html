<p>Assign the specified CPU time quota to the processes executed. Takes a percentage value, suffixed with
          "%". The percentage specifies how much CPU time the unit shall get at maximum, relative to the total CPU time
          available on one CPU. Use values &gt; 100% for allotting CPU time on more than one CPU. This controls the
          cpu.max attribute on the unified control group hierarchy and
          cpu.cfs_quota_us on legacy. For details about these control group attributes, see <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html">Control Groups v2</a> and <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/scheduler/sched-bwc.html">CFS Bandwidth Control</a>.
          Setting <var>CPUQuota=</var> to an empty value unsets the quota.</p>
<p>Example: <var>CPUQuota=20%</var> ensures that the executed processes will never get more than
          20% CPU time on one CPU.</p>
