<p>Set the default overall block I/O weight for the executed processes, if the unified control
          group hierarchy is used on the system. Takes a single weight value (between 1 and 10000) to set the
          default block I/O weight. This controls the io.weight control group attribute,
          which defaults to 100. For details about this control group attribute, see <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#io-interface-files">IO
          Interface Files</a>.  The available I/O bandwidth is split up among all units within one slice
          relative to their block I/O weight. A higher weight means more I/O bandwidth, a lower weight means
          less.</p>
<p>While <var>StartupIOWeight=</var> applies
          to the startup and shutdown phases of the system,
          <var>IOWeight=</var> applies to the later runtime of
          the system, and if the former is not set also to the startup
          and shutdown phases. This allows prioritizing specific services at boot-up
          and shutdown differently than during runtime.</p>
