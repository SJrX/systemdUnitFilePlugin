<p>Specify the memory usage protection of the executed processes in this unit.
          When reclaiming memory, the unit is treated as if it was using less memory resulting in memory
          to be preferentially reclaimed from unprotected units.
          Using <var>MemoryLow=</var> results in a weaker protection where memory may still
          be reclaimed to avoid invoking the OOM killer in case there is no other reclaimable memory.</p>
<p>
          For a protection to be effective, it is generally required to set a corresponding
          allocation on all ancestors, which is then distributed between children
          (with the exception of the root slice).
          Any <var>MemoryMin=</var> or <var>MemoryLow=</var> allocation that is not
          explicitly distributed to specific children is used to create a shared protection for all children.
          As this is a shared protection, the children will freely compete for the memory.</p>
<p>Takes a memory size in bytes. If the value is suffixed with K, M, G or T, the specified memory size is
          parsed as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes (with the base 1024), respectively. Alternatively, a
          percentage value may be specified, which is taken relative to the installed physical memory on the
          system. If assigned the special value infinity, all available memory is protected, which may be
          useful in order to always inherit all of the protection afforded by ancestors.
          This controls the memory.min or memory.low control group attribute.
          For details about this control group attribute, see <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#memory-interface-files">Memory Interface Files</a>.</p>
<p>Units may have their children use a default memory.min or
          memory.low value by specifying <var>DefaultMemoryMin=</var> or
          <var>DefaultMemoryLow=</var>, which has the same semantics as
          <var>MemoryMin=</var> and <var>MemoryLow=</var>.
          This setting does not affect memory.min or memory.low
          in the unit itself.
          Using it to set a default child allocation is only useful on kernels older than 5.7,
          which do not support the memory_recursiveprot cgroup2 mount option.</p>
