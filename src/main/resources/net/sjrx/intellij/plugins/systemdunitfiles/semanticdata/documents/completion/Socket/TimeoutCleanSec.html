<p>Configures a timeout on the clean-up operation requested through systemctl
        clean â€¦, see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)
    </a> for
        details. Takes the usual time values and defaults to infinity, i.e. by default
        no timeout is applied. If a timeout is configured the clean operation will be aborted forcibly when
        the timeout is reached, potentially leaving resources on disk.</p>
