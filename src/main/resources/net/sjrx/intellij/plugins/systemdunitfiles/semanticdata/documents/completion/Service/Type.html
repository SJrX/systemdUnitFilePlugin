<p>Configures the process start-up type for this service unit. One of <var>simple</var>,
          <var>exec</var>, <var>forking</var>, <var>oneshot</var>, <var>dbus</var>,
          <var>notify</var> or <var>idle</var>:</p>
<p>It is generally recommended to use <var>Type=</var><var>simple</var> for long-running
          services whenever possible, as it is the simplest and fastest option. However, as this service type won't
          propagate service start-up failures and doesn't allow ordering of other units against completion of
          initialization of the service (which for example is useful if clients need to connect to the service through
          some form of IPC, and the IPC channel is only established by the service itself — in contrast to doing this
          ahead of time through socket or bus activation or similar), it might not be sufficient for many cases. If so,
          <var>notify</var> or <var>dbus</var> (the latter only in case the service provides a D-Bus
          interface) are the preferred options as they allow service program code to precisely schedule when to
          consider the service started up successfully and when to proceed with follow-up units. The
          <var>notify</var> service type requires explicit support in the service codebase (as
          sd_notify() or an equivalent API needs to be invoked by the service at the appropriate
          time) — if it's not supported, then <var>forking</var> is an alternative: it supports the traditional
          UNIX service start-up protocol. Finally, <var>exec</var> might be an option for cases where it is
          enough to ensure the service binary is invoked, and where the service binary itself executes no or little
          initialization on its own (and its initialization is unlikely to fail). Note that using any type other than
          <var>simple</var> possibly delays the boot process, as the service manager needs to wait for service
          initialization to complete. It is hence recommended not to needlessly use any types other than
          <var>simple</var>. (Also note it is generally not recommended to use <var>idle</var> or
          <var>oneshot</var> for long-running services.)</p>
