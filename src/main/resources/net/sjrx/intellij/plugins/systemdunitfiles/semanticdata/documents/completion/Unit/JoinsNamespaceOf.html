<p>For units that start processes (such as service units), lists one or more other units
        whose network and/or temporary file namespace to join. This only applies to unit types which support
        the <var>PrivateNetwork=</var>, <var>NetworkNamespacePath=</var>,
        <var>PrivateIPC=</var>, <var>IPCNamespacePath=</var>, and
        <var>PrivateTmp=</var> directives (see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)
    </a> for
        details). If a unit that has this setting set is started, its processes will see the same
        /tmp/, /var/tmp/, IPC namespace and network namespace as
        one listed unit that is started. If multiple listed units are already started, it is not defined
        which namespace is joined. Note that this setting only has an effect if
        <var>PrivateNetwork=</var>/<var>NetworkNamespacePath=</var>,
        <var>PrivateIPC=</var>/<var>IPCNamespacePath=</var> and/or
        <var>PrivateTmp=</var> is enabled for both the unit that joins the namespace and the unit
        whose namespace is joined.</p>
