<p>Controls where file descriptor 0 (STDIN) of the executed processes is connected to. Takes one
        of <var>null</var>, <var>tty</var>, <var>tty-force</var>, <var>tty-fail</var>,
        <var>data</var>, <var>file:path</var>, <var>socket</var> or
        <var>fd:name</var>.</p>
<p>If <var>null</var> is selected, standard input will be connected to /dev/null,
        i.e. all read attempts by the process will result in immediate EOF.</p>
<p>If <var>tty</var> is selected, standard input is connected to a TTY (as configured by
        <var>TTYPath=</var>, see below) and the executed process becomes the controlling process of the
        terminal. If the terminal is already being controlled by another process, the executed process waits until the
        current controlling process releases the terminal.</p>
<p><var>tty-force</var> is similar to <var>tty</var>, but the executed process is forcefully and
        immediately made the controlling process of the terminal, potentially removing previous controlling processes
        from the terminal.</p>
<p><var>tty-fail</var> is similar to <var>tty</var>, but if the terminal already has a
        controlling process start-up of the executed process fails.</p>
<p>The <var>data</var> option may be used to configure arbitrary textual or binary data to pass via
        standard input to the executed process. The data to pass is configured via
        <var>StandardInputText=</var>/<var>StandardInputData=</var> (see below). Note that the actual
        file descriptor type passed (memory file, regular file, UNIX pipe, â€¦) might depend on the kernel and available
        privileges. In any case, the file descriptor is read-only, and when read returns the specified data followed by
        EOF.</p>
<p>The <var>file:path</var> option may be used to connect a specific file
        system object to standard input. An absolute path following the : character is expected,
        which may refer to a regular file, a FIFO or special file. If an AF_UNIX socket in the
        file system is specified, a stream socket is connected to it. The latter is useful for connecting standard
        input of processes to arbitrary system services.</p>
<p>The <var>socket</var> option is valid in socket-activated services only, and requires the relevant
        socket unit file (see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.socket.5.html">systemd.socket(5)
    </a> for details)
        to have <var>Accept=yes</var> set, or to specify a single socket only. If this option is set, standard
        input will be connected to the socket the service was activated from, which is primarily useful for
        compatibility with daemons designed for use with the traditional <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/inetd.8.html">inetd(8)
    </a> socket activation
        daemon.</p>
<p>The <var>fd:name</var> option connects standard input to a specific,
        named file descriptor provided by a socket unit. The name may be specified as part of this option, following a
        : character (e.g. fd:foobar). If no name is specified, the name
        stdin is implied (i.e. fd is equivalent to fd:stdin).
        At least one socket unit defining the specified name must be provided via the <var>Sockets=</var>
        option, and the file descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing socket unit. If multiple
        matches are found, the first one will be used. See <var>FileDescriptorName=</var> in
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.socket.5.html">systemd.socket(5)
    </a> for more
        details about named file descriptors and their ordering.</p>
<p>This setting defaults to <var>null</var>, unless
        <var>StandardInputText=</var>/<var>StandardInputData=</var> are set, in which case it
        defaults to <var>data</var>.</p>
