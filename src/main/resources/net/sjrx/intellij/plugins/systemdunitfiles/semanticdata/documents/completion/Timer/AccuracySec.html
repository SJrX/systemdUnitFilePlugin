<p>Specify the accuracy the timer shall elapse
        with. Defaults to 1min. The timer is scheduled to elapse
        within a time window starting with the time specified in
        <var>OnCalendar=</var>,
        <var>OnActiveSec=</var>,
        <var>OnBootSec=</var>,
        <var>OnStartupSec=</var>,
        <var>OnUnitActiveSec=</var> or
        <var>OnUnitInactiveSec=</var> and ending the time
        configured with <var>AccuracySec=</var> later. Within
        this time window, the expiry time will be placed at a
        host-specific, randomized, but stable position that is
        synchronized between all local timer units. This is done in
        order to optimize power consumption to suppress unnecessary
        CPU wake-ups. To get best accuracy, set this option to
        1us. Note that the timer is still subject to the timer slack
        configured via
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf(5)
    </a>'s
        <var>TimerSlackNSec=</var> setting. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)
    </a>
        for details. To optimize power consumption, make sure to set
        this value as high as possible and as low as
        necessary.</p>
<p>Note that this setting is primarily a power saving option that allows coalescing CPU
        wake-ups. It should not be confused with <var>RandomizedDelaySec=</var> (see below) which
        adds a random value to the time the timer shall elapse next and whose purpose is the opposite: to
        stretch elapsing of timer events over a longer period to reduce workload spikes. For further details
        and explanations and how both settings play together, see below.</p>
