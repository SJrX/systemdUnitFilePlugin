<p>Takes a boolean argument. If
        <var>true</var>, this unit may be used with the
        systemctl isolate command. Otherwise, this
        will be refused. It probably is a good idea to leave this
        disabled except for target units that shall be used similar to
        runlevels in SysV init systems, just as a precaution to avoid
        unusable system states. This option defaults to
        <var>false</var>.</p>
