<p>The maximum number of connections to
        simultaneously run services instances for, when
        <var>Accept=yes</var> is set. If more concurrent
        connections are coming in, they will be refused until at least
        one existing connection is terminated. This setting has no
        effect on sockets configured with
        <var>Accept=no</var> or datagram sockets. Defaults to
        64.</p>
