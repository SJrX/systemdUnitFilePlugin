<p>Takes a boolean argument. If enabled, any file nodes created by this socket unit are
        removed when it is stopped. This applies to AF_UNIX sockets in the file system,
        POSIX message queues, FIFOs, as well as any symlinks to them configured with
        <var>Symlinks=</var>. Normally, it should not be necessary to use this option, and is not
        recommended as services might continue to run after the socket unit has been terminated and it should
        still be possible to communicate with them via their file system node. Defaults to
        off.</p>
