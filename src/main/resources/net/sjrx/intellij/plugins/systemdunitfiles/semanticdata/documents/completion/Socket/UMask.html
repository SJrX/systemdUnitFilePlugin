<p>Controls the file mode creation mask. Takes an access mode in octal notation. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/umask.2.html">umask(2)
    </a> for
        details. Defaults to 0022 for system units. For user units the default value is inherited from the
        per-user service manager (whose default is in turn inherited from the system service manager, and
        thus typically also is 0022 â€” unless overridden by a PAM module). In order to change the per-user mask
        for all user services, consider setting the <var>UMask=</var> setting of the user's
        user@.service system service instance. The per-user umask may also be set via
        the <var>umask</var> field of a user's <a href="https://systemd.io/USER_RECORD">JSON User
        Record</a> (for users managed by
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-homed.service.8.html">systemd-homed.service(8)
    </a>
        this field may be controlled via homectl --umask=). It may also be set via a PAM
        module, such as <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam_umask.8.html">pam_umask(8)
    </a>.</p>
