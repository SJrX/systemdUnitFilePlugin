<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, turns on IPv4 and IPv6 network traffic accounting for packets sent
          or received by the unit. When this option is turned on, all IPv4 and IPv6 sockets created by any process of
          the unit are accounted for.</p>
<p>When this option is used in socket units, it applies to all IPv4 and IPv6 sockets
          associated with it (including both listening and connection sockets where this applies). Note that for
          socket-activated services, this configuration setting and the accounting data of the service unit and the
          socket unit are kept separate, and displayed separately. No propagation of the setting and the collected
          statistics is done, in either direction. Moreover, any traffic sent or received on any of the socket unit's
          sockets is accounted to the socket unit â€” and never to the service unit it might have activated, even if the
          socket is used by it.</p>
<p>The system default for this setting may be controlled with <var>DefaultIPAccounting=</var> in
          <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf(5)
    </a>.</p>
