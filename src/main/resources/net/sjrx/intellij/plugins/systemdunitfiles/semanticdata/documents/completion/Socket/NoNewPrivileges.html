<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, ensures that the service process and all its
        children can never gain new privileges through execve() (e.g. via setuid or
        setgid bits, or filesystem capabilities). This is the simplest and most effective way to ensure that
        a process and its children can never elevate privileges again. Defaults to false, but certain
        settings override this and ignore the value of this setting. This is the case when
        <var>DynamicUser=</var>,
        <var>LockPersonality=</var>,
        <var>MemoryDenyWriteExecute=</var>,
        <var>PrivateDevices=</var>,
        <var>ProtectClock=</var>,
        <var>ProtectHostname=</var>,
        <var>ProtectKernelLogs=</var>,
        <var>ProtectKernelModules=</var>,
        <var>ProtectKernelTunables=</var>,
        <var>RestrictAddressFamilies=</var>,
        <var>RestrictNamespaces=</var>,
        <var>RestrictRealtime=</var>,
        <var>RestrictSUIDSGID=</var>,
        <var>SystemCallArchitectures=</var>,
        <var>SystemCallFilter=</var>, or
        <var>SystemCallLog=</var> are specified. Note that even if this setting is overridden
        by them, systemctl show shows the original value of this setting. In case the
        service will be run in a new mount namespace anyway and SELinux is disabled, all file systems
        are mounted with MS_NOSUID flag. Also see

        Privileges Flag</a>.</p>
