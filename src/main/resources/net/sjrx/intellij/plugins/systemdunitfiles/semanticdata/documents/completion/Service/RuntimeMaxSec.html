<p>Configures a maximum time for the service to run. If this is used and the service has been
        active for longer than the specified time it is terminated and put into a failure state. Note that this setting
        does not have any effect on <var>Type=oneshot</var> services, as they terminate immediately after
        activation completed. Pass infinity (the default) to configure no runtime
        limit.</p>
<p>If a service of <var>Type=notify</var> sends EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC=…, this may cause
        the runtime to be extended beyond <var>RuntimeMaxSec=</var>. The first receipt of this message
        must occur before <var>RuntimeMaxSec=</var> is exceeded, and once the runtime has extended beyond
        <var>RuntimeMaxSec=</var>, the service manager will allow the service to continue to run, provided
        the service repeats EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC=… within the interval specified until the service
        shutdown is achieved by STOPPING=1 (or termination). (see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify(3)
    </a>).
