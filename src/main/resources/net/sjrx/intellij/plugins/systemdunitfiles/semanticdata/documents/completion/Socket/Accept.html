<p>Takes a boolean argument. If yes, a service instance is spawned for each incoming
        connection and only the connection socket is passed to it. If no, all listening sockets themselves
        are passed to the started service unit, and only one service unit is spawned for all connections
        (also see above). This value is ignored for datagram sockets and FIFOs where a single service unit
        unconditionally handles all incoming traffic. Defaults to <var>no</var>. For performance
        reasons, it is recommended to write new daemons only in a way that is suitable for
        <var>Accept=no</var>. A daemon listening on an AF_UNIX socket may, but
        does not need to, call
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html">close(2)
    </a> on the
        received socket before exiting. However, it must not unlink the socket from a file system. It should
        not invoke
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shutdown.2.html">shutdown(2)
    </a> on
        sockets it got with <var>Accept=no</var>, but it may do so for sockets it got with
        <var>Accept=yes</var> set. Setting <var>Accept=yes</var> is mostly useful to allow
        daemons designed for usage with <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/inetd.8.html">inetd(8)
    </a> to work
        unmodified with systemd socket activation.</p>
<p>For IPv4 and IPv6 connections, the <var>REMOTE_ADDR</var> environment variable will
        contain the remote IP address, and <var>REMOTE_PORT</var> will contain the remote port. This
        is the same as the format used by CGI. For SOCK_RAW, the port is the IP
        protocol.</p>
<p>It is recommended to set <var>CollectMode=inactive-or-failed</var> for service
        instances activated via <var>Accept=yes</var>, to ensure that failed connection services are
        cleaned up and released from memory, and do not accumulate.</p>
