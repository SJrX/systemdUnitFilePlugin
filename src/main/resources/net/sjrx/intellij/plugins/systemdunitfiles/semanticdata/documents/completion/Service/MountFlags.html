<p>Takes a mount propagation setting: <var>shared</var>, <var>slave</var> or
        <var>private</var>, which controls whether file system mount points in the file system namespaces set up
        for this unit's processes will receive or propagate mounts and unmounts from other file system namespaces. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html">mount(2)
    </a>
        for details on mount propagation, and the three propagation flags in particular.</p>
<p>This setting only controls the final propagation setting in effect on all mount
        points of the file system namespace created for each process of this unit. Other file system namespacing unit
        settings (see the discussion in <var>PrivateMounts=</var> above) will implicitly disable mount and
        unmount propagation from the unit's processes towards the host by changing the propagation setting of all mount
        points in the unit's file system namespace to <var>slave</var> first. Setting this option to
        <var>shared</var> does not reestablish propagation in that case.</p>
<p>If not set – but file system namespaces are enabled through another file system namespace unit setting –
        <var>shared</var> mount propagation is used, but — as mentioned — as <var>slave</var> is applied
        first, propagation from the unit's processes to the host is still turned off.</p>
<p>It is not recommended to use <var>private</var> mount propagation for units, as this means
        temporary mounts (such as removable media) of the host will stay mounted and thus indefinitely busy in forked
        off processes, as unmount propagation events won't be received by the file system namespace of the unit.</p>
<p>Usually, it is best to leave this setting unmodified, and use higher level file system namespacing
        options instead, in particular <var>PrivateMounts=</var>, see above.</p>
