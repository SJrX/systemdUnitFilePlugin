<p>Specifies the name of the socket units this
        service shall inherit socket file descriptors from when the
        service is started. Normally, it should not be necessary to use
        this setting, as all socket file descriptors whose unit shares
        the same name as the service (subject to the different unit
        name suffix of course) are passed to the spawned
        process.</p>
<p>Note that the same socket file descriptors may be passed
        to multiple processes simultaneously. Also note that a
        different service may be activated on incoming socket traffic
        than the one which is ultimately configured to inherit the
        socket file descriptors. Or, in other words: the
        <var>Service=</var> setting of
        .socket units does not have to match the
        inverse of the <var>Sockets=</var> setting of the
        .service it refers to.</p>
<p>This option may appear more than once, in which case the list of socket units is merged. Note
        that once set, clearing the list of sockets again (for example, by assigning the empty string to this
        option) is not supported.</p>
