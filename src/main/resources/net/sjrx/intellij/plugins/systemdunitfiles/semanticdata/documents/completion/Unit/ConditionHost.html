<p><var>ConditionHost=</var> may be used to match against the hostname or
          machine ID of the host. This either takes a hostname string (optionally with shell style globs)
          which is tested against the locally set hostname as returned by
          <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname(2)
    </a>, or
          a machine ID formatted as string (see
          <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)
    </a>).
          The test may be negated by prepending an exclamation mark.</p>
