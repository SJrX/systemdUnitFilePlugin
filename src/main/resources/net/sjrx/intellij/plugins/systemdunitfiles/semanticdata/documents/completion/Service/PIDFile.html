<p>Takes a path referring to the PID file of the service. Usage of this option is recommended for
        services where <var>Type=</var> is set to <var>forking</var>. The path specified typically points
        to a file below /run/. If a relative path is specified it is hence prefixed with
        /run/. The service manager will read the PID of the main process of the service from this
        file after start-up of the service. The service manager will not write to the file configured here, although it
        will remove the file after the service has shut down if it still exists. The PID file does not need to be owned
        by a privileged user, but if it is owned by an unprivileged user additional safety restrictions are enforced:
        the file may not be a symlink to a file owned by a different user (neither directly nor indirectly), and the
        PID file must refer to a process already belonging to the service.</p>
<p>Note that PID files should be avoided in modern projects. Use <var>Type=notify</var> or
        <var>Type=simple</var> where possible, which does not require use of PID files to determine the
        main process of a service and avoids needless forking.</p>
