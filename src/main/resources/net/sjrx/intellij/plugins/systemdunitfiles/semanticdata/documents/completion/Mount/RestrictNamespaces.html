<p>Restricts access to Linux namespace functionality for the processes of this unit. For details
        about Linux namespaces, see <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html">namespaces(7)
    </a>. Either
        takes a boolean argument, or a space-separated list of namespace type identifiers. If false (the default), no
        restrictions on namespace creation and switching are made. If true, access to any kind of namespacing is
        prohibited. Otherwise, a space-separated list of namespace type identifiers must be specified, consisting of
        any combination of: cgroup, ipc, net,
        mnt, pid, user and uts. Any
        namespace type listed is made accessible to the unit's processes, access to namespace types not listed is
        prohibited (allow-listing). By prepending the list with a single tilde character (~) the
        effect may be inverted: only the listed namespace types will be made inaccessible, all unlisted ones are
        permitted (deny-listing). If the empty string is assigned, the default namespace restrictions are applied,
        which is equivalent to false. This option may appear more than once, in which case the namespace types are
        merged by OR, or by AND if the lines are prefixed with
        ~ (see examples below). Internally, this setting limits access to the
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)
    </a>,
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)
    </a> and
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)
    </a> system calls, taking
        the specified flags parameters into account. Note that — if this option is used — in addition to restricting
        creation and switching of the specified types of namespaces (or all of them, if true) access to the
        setns() system call with a zero flags parameter is prohibited. This setting is only
        supported on x86, x86-64, mips, mips-le, mips64, mips64-le, mips64-n32, mips64-le-n32, ppc64, ppc64-le, s390
        and s390x, and enforces no restrictions on other architectures. If running in user mode, or in system mode, but
        without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting <var>User=</var>),
        <var>NoNewPrivileges=yes</var> is implied.</p>
<p>Example: if a unit has the following,
        RestrictNamespaces=cgroup ipc
RestrictNamespaces=cgroup net
        then cgroup, ipc, and net are set.
        If the second line is prefixed with ~, e.g.,
        RestrictNamespaces=cgroup ipc
RestrictNamespaces=~cgroup net
        then, only ipc is set.</p>
