<p>Controls which capabilities to include in the ambient capability set for the executed
        process. Takes a whitespace-separated list of capability names, e.g. CAP_SYS_ADMIN,
        CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, CAP_SYS_PTRACE. This option may appear more than
        once, in which case the ambient capability sets are merged (see the above examples in
        <var>CapabilityBoundingSet=</var>). If the list of capabilities is prefixed with ~,
        all but the listed capabilities will be included, the effect of the assignment inverted. If the empty string is
        assigned to this option, the ambient capability set is reset to the empty capability set, and all prior
        settings have no effect. If set to ~ (without any further argument), the ambient capability
        set is reset to the full set of available capabilities, also undoing any previous settings. Note that adding
        capabilities to the ambient capability set adds them to the process's inherited capability set. </p>
<p>
        Ambient capability sets are useful if you want to execute a process as a non-privileged user but still want to
        give it some capabilities. Note that in this case option keep-caps is automatically added
        to <var>SecureBits=</var> to retain the capabilities over the user
        change. <var>AmbientCapabilities=</var> does not affect commands prefixed with
        +.</p>
