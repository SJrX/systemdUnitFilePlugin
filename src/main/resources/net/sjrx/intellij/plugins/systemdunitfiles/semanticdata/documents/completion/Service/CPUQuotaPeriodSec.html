<p>Assign the duration over which the CPU time quota specified by <var>CPUQuota=</var> is measured.
          Takes a time duration value in seconds, with an optional suffix such as "ms" for milliseconds (or "s" for seconds.)
          The default setting is 100ms. The period is clamped to the range supported by the kernel, which is [1ms, 1000ms].
          Additionally, the period is adjusted up so that the quota interval is also at least 1ms.
          Setting <var>CPUQuotaPeriodSec=</var> to an empty value resets it to the default.</p>
<p>This controls the second field of cpu.max attribute on the unified control group hierarchy
          and cpu.cfs_period_us on legacy. For details about these control group attributes, see
          <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html">Control Groups v2</a> and
          <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/scheduler/sched-design-CFS.html">CFS Scheduler</a>.</p>
<p>Example: <var>CPUQuotaPeriodSec=10ms</var> to request that the CPU quota is measured in periods of 10ms.</p>
