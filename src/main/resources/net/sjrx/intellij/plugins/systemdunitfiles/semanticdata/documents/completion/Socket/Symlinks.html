<p>Takes a list of file system paths. The specified paths will be created as symlinks to the
        AF_UNIX socket path or FIFO path of this socket unit. If this setting is used, only one
        AF_UNIX socket in the file system or one FIFO may be configured for the socket unit. Use
        this option to manage one or more symlinked alias names for a socket, binding their lifecycle together. Note
        that if creation of a symlink fails this is not considered fatal for the socket unit, and the socket unit may
        still start. If an empty string is assigned, the list of paths is reset. Defaults to an empty
        list.</p>
