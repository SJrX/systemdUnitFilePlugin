<p>Takes a PKCS7 signature of the <var>RootHash=</var> option as a path to a
        DER-encoded signature file, or as an ASCII base64 string encoding of a DER-encoded signature prefixed
        by base64:. The dm-verity volume will only be opened if the signature of the root
        hash is valid and signed by a public key present in the kernel keyring. If this option is not
        specified, but a file with the .roothash.p7s suffix is found next to the image
        file, bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the .raw suffix,
        in which case the signature file must not have it in its name), the signature is read from it and
        automatically used.</p>
<p>If the disk image contains a separate /usr/ partition it may also be
        Verity protected, in which case the signature for the root hash may configured via a
        .usrhash.p7s file adjacent to the disk image. There's currently no option to
        configure the root hash signature for the /usr/ via the unit file
        directly.</p>
