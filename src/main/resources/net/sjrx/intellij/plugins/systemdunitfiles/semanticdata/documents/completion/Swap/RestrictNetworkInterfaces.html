<p>Takes a list of space-separated network interface names. This option restricts the network
          interfaces that processes of this unit can use. By default processes can only use the network interfaces
          listed (allow-list). If the first character of the rule is ~, the effect is inverted:
          the processes can only use network interfaces not listed (deny-list).
          </p>
<p>This option can appear multiple times, in which case the network interface names are merged. If the
          empty string is assigned the set is reset, all prior assignments will have not effect.
          </p>
<p>If you specify both types of this option (i.e. allow-listing and deny-listing), the first encountered
          will take precedence and will dictate the default action (allow vs deny). Then the next occurrences of this
          option will add or delete the listed network interface names from the set, depending of its type and the
          default action.
          </p>
<p>The loopback interface ("lo") is not treated in any special way, you have to configure it explicitly
          in the unit file.
          </p>
<p>Example 1: allow-list
          
RestrictNetworkInterfaces=eth1
RestrictNetworkInterfaces=eth2
          Programs in the unit will be only able to use the eth1 and eth2 network
          interfaces.
          </p>
<p>Example 2: deny-list
          
RestrictNetworkInterfaces=~eth1 eth2
          Programs in the unit will be able to use any network interface but eth1 and eth2.
          </p>
<p>Example 3: mixed
          
RestrictNetworkInterfaces=eth1 eth2
RestrictNetworkInterfaces=~eth1
          Programs in the unit will be only able to use the eth2 network interface.
          </p>
