<p>This setting is similar to <var>MountImages=</var> in that it mounts a file
        system hierarchy from a block device node or loopback file, but instead of providing a destination
        path, an overlay will be set up. This option expects a whitespace separated list of mount
        definitions. Each definition consists of a source path, optionally followed by a colon and a list of
        mount options.</p>
<p>A read-only OverlayFS will be set up on top of /usr/ and
        /opt/ hierarchies. The order in which the images are listed will determine the
        order in which the overlay is laid down: images specified first to last will result in overlayfs
        layers bottom to top.</p>
<p>Mount options may be defined as a single comma-separated list of options, in which case they
        will be implicitly applied to the root partition on the image, or a series of colon-separated tuples
        of partition name and mount options. Valid partition names and mount options are the same as for
        <var>RootImageOptions=</var> setting described above.</p>
<p>Each mount definition may be prefixed with -, in which case it will be
        ignored when its source path does not exist. The source argument is a path to a block device node or
        regular file. If the source path contains a :, it needs to be escaped as
        \:. The device node or file system image file needs to follow the same rules as
        specified for <var>RootImage=</var>. Any mounts created with this option are specific to the
        unit, and are not visible in the host's mount table.</p>
<p>These settings may be used more than once, each usage appends to the unit's list of image
        paths. If the empty string is assigned, the entire list of mount paths defined prior to this is
        reset.</p>
<p>Each image must carry a /usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.IMAGE
        file, with the appropriate metadata which matches <var>RootImage=</var>/<var>RootDirectory=</var>
        or the host. See:
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/os-release.5.html">os-release(5)
    </a>.
        To disable the safety check that the extension-release file name matches the image file name, the
        <var>x-systemd.relax-extension-release-check</var> mount option may be appended.</p>
<p>When <var>DevicePolicy=</var> is set to closed or
        strict, or set to auto and <var>DeviceAllow=</var> is
        set, then this setting adds /dev/loop-control with rw mode,
        block-loop and block-blkext with rwm mode
        to <var>DeviceAllow=</var>. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control(5)
    </a>
        for the details about <var>DevicePolicy=</var> or <var>DeviceAllow=</var>. Also, see
        <var>PrivateDevices=</var> below, as it may change the setting of
        <var>DevicePolicy=</var>.</p>
