<p>These options take a whitespace-separated list of directory names. The specified
        directory names must be relative, and may not include ... If set, when the unit is
        started, one or more directories by the specified names will be created (including their parents)
        below the locations defined in the following table. Also, the corresponding environment variable will
        be defined with the full paths of the directories. If multiple directories are set, then in the
        environment variable the paths are concatenated with colon (:).</p>
<p>In case of <var>RuntimeDirectory=</var> the innermost subdirectories are removed when
        the unit is stopped. It is possible to preserve the specified directories in this case if
        <var>RuntimeDirectoryPreserve=</var> is configured to <var>restart</var> or
        <var>yes</var> (see below). The directories specified with <var>StateDirectory=</var>,
        <var>CacheDirectory=</var>, <var>LogsDirectory=</var>,
        <var>ConfigurationDirectory=</var> are not removed when the unit is stopped.</p>
<p>Except in case of <var>ConfigurationDirectory=</var>, the innermost specified directories will be
        owned by the user and group specified in <var>User=</var> and <var>Group=</var>. If the
        specified directories already exist and their owning user or group do not match the configured ones, all files
        and directories below the specified directories as well as the directories themselves will have their file
        ownership recursively changed to match what is configured. As an optimization, if the specified directories are
        already owned by the right user and group, files and directories below of them are left as-is, even if they do
        not match what is requested. The innermost specified directories will have their access mode adjusted to the
        what is specified in <var>RuntimeDirectoryMode=</var>, <var>StateDirectoryMode=</var>,
        <var>CacheDirectoryMode=</var>, <var>LogsDirectoryMode=</var> and
        <var>ConfigurationDirectoryMode=</var>.</p>
<p>These options imply <var>BindPaths=</var> for the specified paths. When combined with
        <var>RootDirectory=</var> or <var>RootImage=</var> these paths always reside on the host and
        are mounted from there into the unit's file system namespace.</p>
<p>If <var>DynamicUser=</var> is used, the logic for <var>CacheDirectory=</var>,
        <var>LogsDirectory=</var> and <var>StateDirectory=</var> is slightly altered: the directories are created below
        /var/cache/private, /var/log/private and /var/lib/private,
        respectively, which are host directories made inaccessible to
        unprivileged users, which ensures that access to these directories cannot be gained through dynamic
        user ID recycling. Symbolic links are created to hide this difference in behaviour. Both from
        perspective of the host and from inside the unit, the relevant directories hence always appear
        directly below /var/cache, /var/log and
        /var/lib.</p>
<p>Use <var>RuntimeDirectory=</var> to manage one or more runtime directories for the unit and bind
        their lifetime to the daemon runtime. This is particularly useful for unprivileged daemons that cannot create
        runtime directories in /run/ due to lack of privileges, and to make sure the runtime
        directory is cleaned up automatically after use. For runtime directories that require more complex or different
        configuration or lifetime guarantees, please consider using
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/tmpfiles.d.5.html">tmpfiles.d(5)
    </a>.</p>
<p><var>RuntimeDirectory=</var>, <var>StateDirectory=</var>, <var>CacheDirectory=</var>
        and <var>LogsDirectory=</var>  optionally support a second parameter, separated by :.
        The second parameter will be interpreted as a destination path that will be created as a symlink to the directory.
        The symlinks will be created after any <var>BindPaths=</var> or <var>TemporaryFileSystem=</var>
        options have been set up, to make ephemeral symlinking possible. The same source can have multiple symlinks, by
        using the same first parameter, but a different second parameter.</p>
