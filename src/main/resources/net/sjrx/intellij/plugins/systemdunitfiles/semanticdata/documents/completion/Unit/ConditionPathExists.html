<p>Check for the existence of a file. If the specified absolute path name does not exist,
          the condition will fail. If the absolute path name passed to
          <var>ConditionPathExists=</var> is prefixed with an exclamation mark
          (!), the test is negated, and the unit is only started if the path does not
          exist.</p>
