<p>These options take boolean arguments. When true, the service unit will be triggered
        when the system clock (CLOCK_REALTIME) jumps relative to the monotonic clock
        (CLOCK_MONOTONIC), or when the local system timezone is modified. These options
        can be used alone or in combination with other timer expressions (see above) within the same timer
        unit. These options default to <var>false</var>.</p>
