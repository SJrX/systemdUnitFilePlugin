<p>Takes time (in seconds) as argument. The connection needs to remain
        idle before TCP starts sending keepalive probes. This controls the TCP_KEEPIDLE

        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html">socket(7)
    </a>
        and the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/">TCP
