<p>Tweaks the "garbage collection" algorithm for this unit. Takes one of <var>inactive</var>
        or <var>inactive-or-failed</var>. If set to <var>inactive</var> the unit will be unloaded if it is
        in the inactive state and is not referenced by clients, jobs or other units — however it
        is not unloaded if it is in the failed state. In <var>failed</var> mode, failed
        units are not unloaded until the user invoked systemctl reset-failed on them to reset the
        failed state, or an equivalent command. This behaviour is altered if this option is set to
        <var>inactive-or-failed</var>: in this case the unit is unloaded even if the unit is in a
        failed state, and thus an explicitly resetting of the failed state is
        not necessary. Note that if this mode is used unit results (such as exit codes, exit signals, consumed
        resources, …) are flushed out immediately after the unit completed, except for what is stored in the logging
        subsystem. Defaults to <var>inactive</var>.</p>
