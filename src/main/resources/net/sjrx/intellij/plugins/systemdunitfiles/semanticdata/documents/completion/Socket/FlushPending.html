<p>Takes a boolean argument. May only be used when
        <var>Accept=no</var>. If yes, the socket's buffers are cleared after the
        triggered service exited. This causes any pending data to be
        flushed and any pending incoming connections to be rejected. If no, the
        socket's buffers won't be cleared, permitting the service to handle any
        pending connections after restart, which is the usually expected behaviour.
        Defaults to <var>no</var>.
