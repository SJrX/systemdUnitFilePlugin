<p>Takes a boolean argument. If set, any attempts to set the set-user-ID (SUID) or
        set-group-ID (SGID) bits on files or directories will be denied (for details on these bits see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inode.7.html">inode(7)
    </a>). If
        running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
        capability (e.g. setting <var>User=</var>), <var>NoNewPrivileges=yes</var> is
        implied. As the SUID/SGID bits are mechanisms to elevate privileges, and allow users to acquire the
        identity of other users, it is recommended to restrict creation of SUID/SGID files to the few
        programs that actually require them. Note that this restricts marking of any type of file system
        object with these bits, including both regular files and directories (where the SGID is a different
        meaning than for files, see documentation). This option is implied if <var>DynamicUser=</var>
        is enabled. Defaults to off.</p>
