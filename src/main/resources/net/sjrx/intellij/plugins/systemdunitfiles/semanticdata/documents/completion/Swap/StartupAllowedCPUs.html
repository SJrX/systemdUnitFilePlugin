<p>Restrict processes to be executed on specific CPUs. Takes a list of CPU indices or ranges separated by either
          whitespace or commas. CPU ranges are specified by the lower and upper CPU indices separated by a dash.</p>
<p>Setting <var>AllowedCPUs=</var> or <var>StartupAllowedCPUs=</var> doesn't guarantee that all
          of the CPUs will be used by the processes as it may be limited by parent units. The effective configuration is
          reported as <var>EffectiveCPUs=</var>.</p>
<p>While <var>StartupAllowedCPUs=</var> applies to the startup and shutdown phases of the system,
          <var>AllowedCPUs=</var> applies to normal runtime of the system, and if the former is not set also to
          the startup and shutdown phases. Using <var>StartupAllowedCPUs=</var> allows prioritizing specific services at
          boot-up and shutdown differently than during normal runtime.</p>
<p>This setting is supported only with the unified control group hierarchy.</p>
