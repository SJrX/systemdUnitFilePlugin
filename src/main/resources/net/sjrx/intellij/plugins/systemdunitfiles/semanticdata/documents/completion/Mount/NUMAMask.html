<p>Controls the NUMA node list which will be applied alongside with selected NUMA policy.
        Takes a list of NUMA nodes and has the same syntax as a list of CPUs for <var>CPUAffinity=</var>
        option or special "all" value which will include all available NUMA nodes in the mask. Note that the list
        of NUMA nodes is not required for <var>default</var> and <var>local</var>
        policies and for <var>preferred</var> policy we expect a single NUMA node.</p>
