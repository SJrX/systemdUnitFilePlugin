<p>Takes a directory path relative to the host's root directory (i.e. the root of the system
        running the service manager). Sets the root directory for executed processes, with the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chroot.2.html">chroot(2)
    </a> system
        call. If this is used, it must be ensured that the process binary and all its auxiliary files are available in
        the chroot() jail. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional
        dependencies to be added to the unit (see above).</p>
<p>The <var>MountAPIVFS=</var> and <var>PrivateUsers=</var> settings are particularly useful
        in conjunction with <var>RootDirectory=</var>. For details, see below.</p>
<p>If <var>RootDirectory=</var>/<var>RootImage=</var> are used together with
        <var>NotifyAccess=</var> the notification socket is automatically mounted from the host into
        the root environment, to ensure the notification interface can work correctly.</p>
<p>Note that services using <var>RootDirectory=</var>/<var>RootImage=</var> will
        not be able to log via the syslog or journal protocols to the host logging infrastructure, unless the
        relevant sockets are mounted from the host, specifically:</p>
