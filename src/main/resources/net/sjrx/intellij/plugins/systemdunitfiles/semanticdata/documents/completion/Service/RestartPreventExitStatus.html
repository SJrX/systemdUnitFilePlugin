<p>Takes a list of exit status definitions that, when returned by the main service
        process, will prevent automatic service restarts, regardless of the restart setting configured with
        <var>Restart=</var>. Exit status definitions can either be numeric exit codes or termination
        signal names, and are separated by spaces. Defaults to the empty list, so that, by default, no exit
        status is excluded from the configured restart logic. For example:

        RestartPreventExitStatus=1 6 SIGABRT

        ensures that exit codes 1 and 6 and the termination signal SIGABRT will not
        result in automatic service restarting. This option may appear more than once, in which case the list
        of restart-preventing statuses is merged. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list is
        reset and all prior assignments of this option will have no effect.</p>
<p>Note that this setting has no effect on processes configured via
        <var>ExecStartPre=</var>, <var>ExecStartPost=</var>, <var>ExecStop=</var>,
        <var>ExecStopPost=</var> or <var>ExecReload=</var>, but only on the main service
        process, i.e. either the one invoked by <var>ExecStart=</var> or (depending on
        <var>Type=</var>, <var>PIDFile=</var>, â€¦) the otherwise configured main
        process.</p>
