<p>Takes a space-separated list of system call names. If this setting is used, all
        system calls executed by the unit processes except for the listed ones will result in immediate
        process termination with the SIGSYS signal (allow-listing). (See
        <var>SystemCallErrorNumber=</var> below for changing the default action). If the first
        character of the list is ~, the effect is inverted: only the listed system calls
        will result in immediate process termination (deny-listing). Deny-listed system calls and system call
        groups may optionally be suffixed with a colon (:) and errno
        error number (between 0 and 4095) or errno name such as EPERM,
        EACCES or EUCLEAN (see <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html">errno(3)
    </a> for a
        full list). This value will be returned when a deny-listed system call is triggered, instead of
        terminating the processes immediately. Special setting kill can be used to
        explicitly specify killing. This value takes precedence over the one given in
        <var>SystemCallErrorNumber=</var>, see below. If running in user mode, or in system mode,
        but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting
        <var>User=</var>), <var>NoNewPrivileges=yes</var> is implied. This feature
        makes use of the Secure Computing Mode 2 interfaces of the kernel ('seccomp filtering') and is useful
        for enforcing a minimal sandboxing environment. Note that the execve(),
        exit(), exit_group(), getrlimit(),
        rt_sigreturn(), sigreturn() system calls and the system calls
        for querying time and sleeping are implicitly allow-listed and do not need to be listed
        explicitly. This option may be specified more than once, in which case the filter masks are
        merged. If the empty string is assigned, the filter is reset, all prior assignments will have no
        effect. This does not affect commands prefixed with +.</p>
<p>Note that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86-64) it is recommended to turn off
        alternative ABIs for services, so that they cannot be used to circumvent the restrictions of this
        option. Specifically, it is recommended to combine this option with
        <var>SystemCallArchitectures=native</var> or similar.</p>
<p>Note that strict system call filters may impact execution and error handling code paths of the service
        invocation. Specifically, access to the execve() system call is required for the execution
        of the service binary — if it is blocked service invocation will necessarily fail. Also, if execution of the
        service binary fails for some reason (for example: missing service executable), the error handling logic might
        require access to an additional set of system calls in order to process and log this failure correctly. It
        might be necessary to temporarily disable system call filters in order to simplify debugging of such
        failures.</p>
<p>If you specify both types of this option (i.e. allow-listing and deny-listing), the first
        encountered will take precedence and will dictate the default action (termination or approval of a
        system call). Then the next occurrences of this option will add or delete the listed system calls
        from the set of the filtered system calls, depending of its type and the default action. (For
        example, if you have started with an allow list rule for read() and
        write(), and right after it add a deny list rule for write(),
        then write() will be removed from the set.)</p>
<p>As the number of possible system calls is large, predefined sets of system calls are provided. A set
        starts with @ character, followed by name of the set.

                A reasonable set of system calls used by common system services, excluding any special purpose calls.

For example, the following APIs are excluded: @clock, @mount, @swap, @reboot.
              
              
                @timer
                System calls for scheduling operations by time (<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/alarm.2.html">alarm(2)
    </a>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timer_create.2.html">timer_create(2)

                @known
                All system calls defined by the kernel. This list is defined statically in systemd based on a kernel version that was available when this systemd version was released. It will become progressively more out-of-date as the kernel is updated.
              
            
          
        

        Note, that as new system calls are added to the kernel, additional system calls might be added to the groups
        above. Contents of the sets may also change between systemd versions. In addition, the list of system calls
        depends on the kernel version and architecture for which systemd was compiled. Use
        systemd-analyze syscall-filter to list the actual list of system calls in each
        filter.</p>
<p>Generally, allow-listing system calls (rather than deny-listing) is the safer mode of
        operation. It is recommended to enforce system call allow lists for all long-running system
        services. Specifically, the following lines are a relatively safe basic choice for the majority of
        system services:</p>
<p>Note that various kernel system calls are defined redundantly: there are multiple system calls
        for executing the same operation. For example, the pidfd_send_signal() system
        call may be used to execute operations similar to what can be done with the older
        kill() system call, hence blocking the latter without the former only provides
        weak protection. Since new system calls are added regularly to the kernel as development progresses,
        keeping system call deny lists comprehensive requires constant work. It is thus recommended to use
        allow-listing instead, which offers the benefit that new system calls are by default implicitly
        blocked until the allow list is updated.</p>
<p>Also note that a number of system calls are required to be accessible for the dynamic linker to
        work. The dynamic linker is required for running most regular programs (specifically: all dynamic ELF
        binaries, which is how most distributions build packaged programs). This means that blocking these
        system calls (which include open(), openat() or
        mmap()) will make most programs typically shipped with generic distributions
        unusable.</p>
<p>It is recommended to combine the file system namespacing related options with
        <var>SystemCallFilter=~@mount</var>, in order to prohibit the unit's processes to undo the
        mappings. Specifically these are the options <var>PrivateTmp=</var>,
        <var>PrivateDevices=</var>, <var>ProtectSystem=</var>, <var>ProtectHome=</var>,
        <var>ProtectKernelTunables=</var>, <var>ProtectControlGroups=</var>,
        <var>ProtectKernelLogs=</var>, <var>ProtectClock=</var>, <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var>,
        <var>InaccessiblePaths=</var> and <var>ReadWritePaths=</var>.</p>
