<p>Set the SELinux security context of the executed process. If set, this will override the
        automated domain transition. However, the policy still needs to authorize the transition. This directive is
        ignored if SELinux is disabled. If prefixed by -, failing to set the SELinux
        security context will be ignored, but it's still possible that the subsequent
        execve() may fail if the policy doesn't allow the transition for the
        non-overridden context. This does not affect commands prefixed with +. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/setexeccon.3.html">setexeccon(3)
    </a>
        for details.</p>
