<p>Controls the secure bits set for the executed process. Takes a space-separated combination of
        options from the following list: <var>keep-caps</var>, <var>keep-caps-locked</var>,
        <var>no-setuid-fixup</var>, <var>no-setuid-fixup-locked</var>, <var>noroot</var>, and
        <var>noroot-locked</var>. This option may appear more than once, in which case the secure bits are
        ORed. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the bits are reset to 0. This does not affect commands
        prefixed with +. See <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)
    </a> for
        details.</p>
