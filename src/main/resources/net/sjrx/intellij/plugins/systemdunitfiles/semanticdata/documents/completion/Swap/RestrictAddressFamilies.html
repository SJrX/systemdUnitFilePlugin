<p>Restricts the set of socket address families accessible to the processes of this
        unit. Takes none, or a space-separated list of address family names to
        allow-list, such as AF_UNIX, AF_INET or
        AF_INET6. When none is specified, then all address
        families will be denied. When prefixed with ~ the listed address
        families will be applied as deny list, otherwise as allow list. Note that this restricts access
        to the
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html">socket(2)
    </a>
        system call only. Sockets passed into the process by other means (for example, by using socket
        activation with socket units, see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.socket.5.html">systemd.socket(5)
    </a>)
        are unaffected. Also, sockets created with socketpair() (which creates connected
        AF_UNIX sockets only) are unaffected. Note that this option has no effect on 32-bit x86, s390, s390x,
        mips, mips-le, ppc, ppc-le, ppc64, ppc64-le and is ignored (but works correctly on other ABIs,
        including x86-64). Note that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86-64) it is
        recommended to turn off alternative ABIs for services, so that they cannot be used to circumvent the
        restrictions of this option. Specifically, it is recommended to combine this option with
        <var>SystemCallArchitectures=native</var> or similar. If running in user mode, or in system
        mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting
        <var>User=</var>), <var>NoNewPrivileges=yes</var> is implied. By default, no
        restrictions apply, all address families are accessible to processes. If assigned the empty string,
        any previous address family restriction changes are undone. This setting does not affect commands
        prefixed with +.</p>
<p>Use this option to limit exposure of processes to remote access, in particular via exotic and sensitive
        network protocols, such as AF_PACKET. Note that in most cases, the local
        AF_UNIX address family should be included in the configured allow list as it is frequently
        used for local communication, including for
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syslog.2.html">syslog(2)
    </a>
        logging.</p>
