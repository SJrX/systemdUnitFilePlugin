<p>Sets the I/O scheduling class for executed processes. Takes one of the strings
        <var>realtime</var>, <var>best-effort</var> or <var>idle</var>. The kernel's
        default scheduling class is <var>best-effort</var> at a priority of 4. If the empty string is
        assigned to this option, all prior assignments to both <var>IOSchedulingClass=</var> and
        <var>IOSchedulingPriority=</var> have no effect. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioprio_set.2.html">ioprio_set(2)
    </a> for
        details.</p>
