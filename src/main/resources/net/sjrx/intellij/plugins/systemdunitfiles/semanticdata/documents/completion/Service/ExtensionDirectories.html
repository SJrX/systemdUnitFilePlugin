<p>This setting is similar to <var>BindReadOnlyPaths=</var> in that it mounts a file
        system hierarchy from a directory, but instead of providing a destination path, an overlay will be set
        up. This option expects a whitespace separated list of source directories.</p>
<p>A read-only OverlayFS will be set up on top of /usr/ and
        /opt/ hierarchies. The order in which the directories are listed will determine
        the order in which the overlay is laid down: directories specified first to last will result in overlayfs
        layers bottom to top.</p>
<p>Each directory listed in <var>ExtensionDirectories=</var> may be prefixed with -,
        in which case it will be ignored when its source path does not exist. Any mounts created with this option are
        specific to the unit, and are not visible in the host's mount table.</p>
<p>These settings may be used more than once, each usage appends to the unit's list of directories
        paths. If the empty string is assigned, the entire list of mount paths defined prior to this is
        reset.</p>
<p>Each directory must contain a /usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.IMAGE
        file, with the appropriate metadata which matches <var>RootImage=</var>/<var>RootDirectory=</var>
        or the host. See:
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/os-release.5.html">os-release(5)
    </a>.</p>
<p>Note that usage from user units requires overlayfs support in unprivileged user namespaces,
        which was first introduced in kernel v5.11.</p>
