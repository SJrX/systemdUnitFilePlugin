<p>Takes a boolean argument. This condition may be used to conditionalize units on
          whether the system is booting up for the first time. This roughly means that /etc/
          was unpopulated when the system started booting (for details, see "First Boot Semantics" in
          <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)
    </a>).
          First boot is considered finished (this condition will evaluate as false) after the manager
          has finished the startup phase.</p>
<p>This condition may be used to populate /etc/ on the first boot after
          factory reset, or when a new system instance boots up for the first time.</p>
<p>For robustness, units with <var>ConditionFirstBoot=yes</var> should order themselves
          before first-boot-complete.target and pull in this passive target with
          <var>Wants=</var>. This ensures that in a case of an aborted first boot, these units will
          be re-run during the next system startup.</p>
<p>If the <var>systemd.condition-first-boot=</var> option is specified on the kernel
          command line (taking a boolean), it will override the result of this condition check, taking
          precedence over /etc/machine-id existence checks.</p>
