<p>Takes a boolean argument. If set, attempts to create memory mappings that are writable and
        executable at the same time, or to change existing memory mappings to become executable, or mapping shared
        memory segments as executable, are prohibited. Specifically, a system call filter is added that rejects
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)
    </a> system calls with both
        PROT_EXEC and PROT_WRITE set,
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html">mprotect(2)
    </a> or
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pkey_mprotect.2.html">pkey_mprotect(2)
    </a> system calls
        with PROT_EXEC set and
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmat.2.html">shmat(2)
    </a> system calls with
        SHM_EXEC set. Note that this option is incompatible with programs and libraries that
        generate program code dynamically at runtime, including JIT execution engines, executable stacks, and code
        "trampoline" feature of various C compilers. This option improves service security, as it makes harder for
        software exploits to change running code dynamically. However, the protection can be circumvented, if
        the service can write to a filesystem, which is not mounted with noexec (such as
        /dev/shm), or it can use memfd_create(). This can be
        prevented by making such file systems inaccessible to the service
        (e.g. <var>InaccessiblePaths=/dev/shm</var>) and installing further system call filters
        (<var>SystemCallFilter=~memfd_create</var>). Note that this feature is fully available on
        x86-64, and partially on x86. Specifically, the shmat() protection is not
        available on x86. Note that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86-64) it is
        recommended to turn off alternative ABIs for services, so that they cannot be used to circumvent the
        restrictions of this option. Specifically, it is recommended to combine this option with
        <var>SystemCallArchitectures=native</var> or similar. If running in user mode, or in system
        mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting
        <var>User=</var>), <var>NoNewPrivileges=yes</var> is implied.</p>
