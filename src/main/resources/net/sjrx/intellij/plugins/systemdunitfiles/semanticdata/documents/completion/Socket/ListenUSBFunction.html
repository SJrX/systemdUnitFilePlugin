<p>Specifies a <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/usb/functionfs.html">USB
        FunctionFS</a> endpoints location to listen on, for
        implementation of USB gadget functions. This expects an
        absolute file system path of a FunctionFS mount point as the argument.
        Behavior otherwise is very similar to the <var>ListenFIFO=</var>
        directive above. Use this to open the FunctionFS endpoint
        ep0. When using this option, the
        activated service has to have the
        <var>USBFunctionDescriptors=</var> and
        <var>USBFunctionStrings=</var> options set.
