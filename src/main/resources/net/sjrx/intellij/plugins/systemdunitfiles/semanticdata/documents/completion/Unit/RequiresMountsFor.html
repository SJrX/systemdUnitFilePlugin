<p>Takes a space-separated list of absolute
        paths. Automatically adds dependencies of type
        <var>Requires=</var> and <var>After=</var> for
        all mount units required to access the specified path.</p>
<p>Mount points marked with <var>noauto</var> are not
        mounted automatically through local-fs.target,
        but are still honored for the purposes of this option, i.e. they
        will be pulled in by this unit.</p>
