<p>Turns on delegation of further resource control partitioning to processes of the unit. Units where this
          is enabled may create and manage their own private subhierarchy of control groups below the control group of
          the unit itself. For unprivileged services (i.e. those using the <var>User=</var> setting) the unit's
          control group will be made accessible to the relevant user. When enabled the service manager will refrain
          from manipulating control groups or moving processes below the unit's control group, so that a clear concept
          of ownership is established: the control group tree above the unit's control group (i.e. towards the root
          control group) is owned and managed by the service manager of the host, while the control group tree below
          the unit's control group is owned and managed by the unit itself. Takes either a boolean argument or a list
          of control group controller names. If true, delegation is turned on, and all supported controllers are
          enabled for the unit, making them available to the unit's processes for management. If false, delegation is
          turned off entirely (and no additional controllers are enabled). If set to a list of controllers, delegation
          is turned on, and the specified controllers are enabled for the unit. Note that additional controllers than
          the ones specified might be made available as well, depending on configuration of the containing slice unit
          or other units contained in it. Note that assigning the empty string will enable delegation, but reset the
          list of controllers, all assignments prior to this will have no effect.  Defaults to false.</p>
<p>Note that controller delegation to less privileged code is only safe on the unified control group
          hierarchy. Accordingly, access to the specified controllers will not be granted to unprivileged services on
          the legacy hierarchy, even when requested.</p>
<p>Not all of these controllers are available on all kernels however, and some are
          specific to the unified hierarchy while others are specific to the legacy hierarchy. Also note that the
          kernel might support further controllers, which aren't covered here yet as delegation is either not supported
          at all for them or not defined cleanly.</p>
