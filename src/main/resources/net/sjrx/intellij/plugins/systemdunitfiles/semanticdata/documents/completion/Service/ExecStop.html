<p>Commands to execute to stop the service started via
        <var>ExecStart=</var>. This argument takes multiple command lines, following the same scheme
        as described for <var>ExecStart=</var> above. Use of this setting is optional. After the
        commands configured in this option are run, it is implied that the service is stopped, and any
        processes remaining for it are terminated according to the <var>KillMode=</var> setting (see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.kill.5.html">systemd.kill(5)
    </a>).
        If this option is not specified, the process is terminated by sending the signal specified in
        <var>KillSignal=</var> or <var>RestartKillSignal=</var> when service stop is
        requested. Specifier and environment variable substitution is supported (including
        <var>$MAINPID</var>, see above).</p>
<p>Note that it is usually not sufficient to specify a command for this setting that only asks the
        service to terminate (for example, by sending some form of termination signal to it), but does not
        wait for it to do so. Since the remaining processes of the services are killed according to
        <var>KillMode=</var> and <var>KillSignal=</var> or
        <var>RestartKillSignal=</var> as described above immediately after the command exited, this
        may not result in a clean stop. The specified command should hence be a synchronous operation, not an
        asynchronous one.</p>
<p>Note that the commands specified in <var>ExecStop=</var> are only executed when the service
        started successfully first. They are not invoked if the service was never started at all, or in case its
        start-up failed, for example because any of the commands specified in <var>ExecStart=</var>,
        <var>ExecStartPre=</var> or <var>ExecStartPost=</var> failed (and weren't prefixed with
        -, see above) or timed out. Use <var>ExecStopPost=</var> to invoke commands when a
        service failed to start up correctly and is shut down again. Also note that the stop operation is always
        performed if the service started successfully, even if the processes in the service terminated on their
        own or were killed. The stop commands must be prepared to deal with that case. <var>$MAINPID</var>
        will be unset if systemd knows that the main process exited by the time the stop commands are called.</p>
<p>Service restart requests are implemented as stop operations followed by start operations. This
        means that <var>ExecStop=</var> and <var>ExecStopPost=</var> are executed during a
        service restart operation.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use this setting for commands that communicate with the service requesting
        clean termination. For post-mortem clean-up steps use <var>ExecStopPost=</var> instead.
        </p>
