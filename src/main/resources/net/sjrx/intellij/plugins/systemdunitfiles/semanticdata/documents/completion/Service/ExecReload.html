<p>Commands to execute to trigger a configuration
        reload in the service. This argument takes multiple command
        lines, following the same scheme as described for
        <var>ExecStart=</var> above. Use of this setting is
        optional. Specifier and environment variable substitution is
        supported here following the same scheme as for
        <var>ExecStart=</var>.</p>
<p>One additional, special environment variable is set: if
        known, <var>$MAINPID</var> is set to the main process
        of the daemon, and may be used for command lines like the
        following:</p>
<p>Note however that reloading a daemon by sending a signal
        (as with the example line above) is usually not a good choice,
        because this is an asynchronous operation and hence not
        suitable to order reloads of multiple services against each
        other. It is strongly recommended to set
        <var>ExecReload=</var> to a command that not only
        triggers a configuration reload of the daemon, but also
        synchronously waits for it to complete. For example,
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dbus-broker.1.html">dbus-broker(1)
    </a>
        uses the following:</p>
