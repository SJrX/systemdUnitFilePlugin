<p>Takes time (in seconds) as argument. If set,
        the listening process will be awakened only when data arrives
        on the socket, and not immediately when connection is
        established. When this option is set, the
        TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT socket option will be
        used (see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/tcp.7.html">tcp(7)
    </a>),
        and the kernel will ignore initial ACK packets without any
        data. The argument specifies the approximate amount of time
        the kernel should wait for incoming data before falling back
        to the normal behavior of honoring empty ACK packets. This
        option is beneficial for protocols where the client sends the
        data first (e.g. HTTP, in contrast to SMTP), because the
        server process will not be woken up unnecessarily before it
        can take any action.
        </p>
<p>If the client also uses the
        TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT option, the latency of
        the initial connection may be reduced, because the kernel will
        send data in the final packet establishing the connection (the
        third packet in the "three-way handshake").</p>
