<p>Controls which kernel architecture <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/uname.2.html">uname(2)
    </a> shall report,
        when invoked by unit processes. Takes one of the architecture identifiers x86,
        x86-64, ppc, ppc-le, ppc64,
        ppc64-le, s390 or s390x. Which personality
        architectures are supported depends on the system architecture. Usually the 64bit versions of the various
        system architectures support their immediate 32bit personality architecture counterpart, but no others. For
        example, x86-64 systems support the x86-64 and
        x86 personalities but no others. The personality feature is useful when running 32-bit
        services on a 64-bit host system. If not specified, the personality is left unmodified and thus reflects the
        personality of the host system's kernel.</p>
