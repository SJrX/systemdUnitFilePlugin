<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, explicit module loading will be denied. This allows
        module load and unload operations to be turned off on modular kernels. It is recommended to turn this on for most services
        that do not need special file systems or extra kernel modules to work. Defaults to off. Enabling this option
        removes CAP_SYS_MODULE from the capability bounding set for the unit, and installs a
        system call filter to block module system calls, also /usr/lib/modules is made
        inaccessible. For this setting the same restrictions regarding mount propagation and privileges apply as for
        <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var> and related calls, see above. Note that limited automatic module loading due
        to user configuration or kernel mapping tables might still happen as side effect of requested user operations,
        both privileged and unprivileged. To disable module auto-load feature please see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sysctl.d.5.html">sysctl.d(5)
    </a>
        kernel.modules_disabled mechanism and
        /proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled documentation. If this setting is on,
        but the unit doesn't have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. services for
        which <var>User=</var> is set), <var>NoNewPrivileges=yes</var> is implied.</p>
