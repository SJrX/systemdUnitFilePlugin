<p>These two settings expect a space-separated list of unit names. They may be specified
        more than once, in which case dependencies for all listed names are created.</p>
<p>Those two settings configure ordering dependencies between units. If unit
        foo.service contains the setting <var>Before=bar.service</var> and both
        units are being started, bar.service's start-up is delayed until
        foo.service has finished starting up. <var>After=</var> is the inverse
        of <var>Before=</var>, i.e. while <var>Before=</var> ensures that the configured unit
        is started before the listed unit begins starting up, <var>After=</var> ensures the opposite,
        that the listed unit is fully started up before the configured unit is started.</p>
<p>When two units with an ordering dependency between them are shut down, the inverse of the
        start-up order is applied. I.e. if a unit is configured with <var>After=</var> on another
        unit, the former is stopped before the latter if both are shut down. Given two units with any
        ordering dependency between them, if one unit is shut down and the other is started up, the shutdown
        is ordered before the start-up. It doesn't matter if the ordering dependency is
        <var>After=</var> or <var>Before=</var>, in this case. It also doesn't matter which
        of the two is shut down, as long as one is shut down and the other is started up; the shutdown is
        ordered before the start-up in all cases. If two units have no ordering dependencies between them,
        they are shut down or started up simultaneously, and no ordering takes place. It depends on the unit
        type when precisely a unit has finished starting up. Most importantly, for service units start-up is
        considered completed for the purpose of <var>Before=</var>/<var>After=</var> when all
        its configured start-up commands have been invoked and they either failed or reported start-up
        success. Note that this does includes <var>ExecStartPost=</var> (or
        <var>ExecStopPost=</var> for the shutdown case).</p>
<p>Note that those settings are independent of and orthogonal to the requirement dependencies as
        configured by <var>Requires=</var>, <var>Wants=</var>, <var>Requisite=</var>,
        or <var>BindsTo=</var>. It is a common pattern to include a unit name in both the
        <var>After=</var> and <var>Wants=</var> options, in which case the unit listed will
        be started before the unit that is configured with these options.</p>
<p>Note that <var>Before=</var> dependencies on device units have no effect and are not
        supported.  Devices generally become available as a result of an external hotplug event, and systemd
        creates the corresponding device unit without delay.</p>
