<p>Configures the watchdog timeout for a service.
        The watchdog is activated when the start-up is completed. The
        service must call
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify(3)
    </a>
        regularly with WATCHDOG=1 (i.e. the
        "keep-alive ping"). If the time between two such calls is
        larger than the configured time, then the service is placed in
        a failed state and it will be terminated with
        SIGABRT (or the signal specified by
        <var>WatchdogSignal=</var>). By setting
        <var>Restart=</var> to <var>on-failure</var>,
        <var>on-watchdog</var>, <var>on-abnormal</var> or
        <var>always</var>, the service will be automatically
        restarted. The time configured here will be passed to the
        executed service process in the
        <var>WATCHDOG_USEC=</var> environment variable. This
        allows daemons to automatically enable the keep-alive pinging
        logic if watchdog support is enabled for the service. If this
        option is used, <var>NotifyAccess=</var> (see below)
        should be set to open access to the notification socket
        provided by systemd. If <var>NotifyAccess=</var> is
        not set, it will be implicitly set to <var>main</var>.
        Defaults to 0, which disables this feature. The service can
        check whether the service manager expects watchdog keep-alive
        notifications. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd_watchdog_enabled.3.html">sd_watchdog_enabled(3)

        may be used to enable automatic watchdog notification support.
