<p>Commands with their arguments that are
        executed when this service is started. The value is split into
        zero or more command lines according to the rules described
        below (see section "Command Lines" below).
        </p>
<p>Unless <var>Type=</var> is <var>oneshot</var>, exactly one command must be given. When
        <var>Type=oneshot</var> is used, zero or more commands may be specified. Commands may be specified by
        providing multiple command lines in the same directive, or alternatively, this directive may be specified more
        than once with the same effect. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of commands to start
        is reset, prior assignments of this option will have no effect. If no <var>ExecStart=</var> is
        specified, then the service must have <var>RemainAfterExit=yes</var> and at least one
        <var>ExecStop=</var> line set. (Services lacking both <var>ExecStart=</var> and
        <var>ExecStop=</var> are not valid.)</p>
<p>For each of the specified commands, the first argument must be either an absolute path to an executable
        or a simple file name without any slashes. Optionally, this filename may be prefixed with a number of special
        characters:</p>
<p>@, -, :, and one of
        +/!/!! may be used together and they can appear in any
        order. However, only one of +, !, !! may be used at a
        time. Note that these prefixes are also supported for the other command line settings,
        i.e. <var>ExecStartPre=</var>, <var>ExecStartPost=</var>, <var>ExecReload=</var>,
        <var>ExecStop=</var> and <var>ExecStopPost=</var>.</p>
<p>If more than one command is specified, the commands are
        invoked sequentially in the order they appear in the unit
        file. If one of the commands fails (and is not prefixed with
        -), other lines are not executed, and the
        unit is considered failed.</p>
<p>Unless <var>Type=forking</var> is set, the
        process started via this command line will be considered the
        main process of the daemon.</p>
