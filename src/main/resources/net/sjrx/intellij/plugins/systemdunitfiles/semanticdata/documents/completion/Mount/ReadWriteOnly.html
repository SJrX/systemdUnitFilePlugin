<p>Takes a boolean argument. If false, a mount
        point that shall be mounted read-write but cannot be mounted
        so is retried to be mounted read-only. If true the operation
        will fail immediately after the read-write mount attempt did
        not succeed. This corresponds with
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)
    </a>'s
        -w switch. Defaults to
        off.</p>
