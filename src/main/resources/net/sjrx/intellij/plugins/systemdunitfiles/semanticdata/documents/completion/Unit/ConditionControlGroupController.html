<p>Check whether given cgroup controllers (e.g. cpu) are available
          for use on the system.</p>
<p>Multiple controllers may be passed with a space separating them; in this case the condition
          will only pass if all listed controllers are available for use. Controllers unknown to systemd are
          ignored. Valid controllers are cpu, cpuset,
          io, memory, and pids. Even if available in
          the kernel, a particular controller may not be available if it was disabled on the kernel command
          line with <var>cgroup_disable=controller</var>.</p>
