<p>A space-separated list of additional names this unit shall be installed under. The names listed
        here must have the same suffix (i.e. type) as the unit filename. This option may be specified more than once,
        in which case all listed names are used. At installation time, systemctl enable will create
        symlinks from these names to the unit filename. Note that not all unit types support such alias names, and this
        setting is not supported for them. Specifically, mount, slice, swap, and automount units do not support
        aliasing.</p>
