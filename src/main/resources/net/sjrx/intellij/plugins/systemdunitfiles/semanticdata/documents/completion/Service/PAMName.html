<p>Sets the PAM service name to set up a session as. If set, the executed process will be
        registered as a PAM session under the specified service name. This is only useful in conjunction with the
        <var>User=</var> setting, and is otherwise ignored. If not set, no PAM session will be opened for the
        executed processes. See <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam.8.html">pam(8)
    </a> for
        details.</p>
<p>Note that for each unit making use of this option a PAM session handler process will be maintained as
        part of the unit and stays around as long as the unit is active, to ensure that appropriate actions can be
        taken when the unit and hence the PAM session terminates. This process is named (sd-pam) and
        is an immediate child process of the unit's main process.</p>
<p>Note that when this option is used for a unit it is very likely (depending on PAM configuration) that the
        main unit process will be migrated to its own session scope unit when it is activated. This process will hence
        be associated with two units: the unit it was originally started from (and for which
        <var>PAMName=</var> was configured), and the session scope unit. Any child processes of that process
        will however be associated with the session scope unit only. This has implications when used in combination
        with <var>NotifyAccess=</var><var>all</var>, as these child processes will not be able to affect
        changes in the original unit through notification messages. These messages will be considered belonging to the
        session scope unit and not the original unit. It is hence not recommended to use <var>PAMName=</var> in
        combination with <var>NotifyAccess=</var><var>all</var>.</p>
