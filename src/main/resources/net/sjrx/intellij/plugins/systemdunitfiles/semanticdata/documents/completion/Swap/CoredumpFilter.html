<p>Controls which types of memory mappings will be saved if the process dumps core
        (using the /proc/pid/coredump_filter file). Takes a
        whitespace-separated combination of mapping type names or numbers (with the default base 16). Mapping
        type names are private-anonymous, shared-anonymous,
        private-file-backed, shared-file-backed,
        elf-headers, private-huge,
        shared-huge, private-dax, shared-dax,
        and the special values all (all types) and default (the
        kernel default of private-anonymous
        shared-anonymous elf-headers
        private-huge). See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html">core(5)
    </a>
        for the meaning of the mapping types. When specified multiple times, all specified masks are
        ORed. When not set, or if the empty value is assigned, the inherited value is not changed.</p>
