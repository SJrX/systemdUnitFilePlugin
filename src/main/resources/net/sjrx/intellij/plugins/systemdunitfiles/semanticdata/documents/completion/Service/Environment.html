<p>Sets environment variables for executed processes. Each line is unquoted using the
        rules described in "Quoting" section in

        and becomes a list of variable assignments. If you need to assign a value containing spaces or the
        equals sign to a variable, put quotes around the whole assignment. Variable expansion is not
        performed inside the strings and the $ character has no special meaning. Specifier
        expansion is performed, see the "Specifiers" section in
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)
    </a>.

<p>This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed variables will be set. If
        the same variable is listed twice, the later setting will override the earlier setting. If the empty
        string is assigned to this option, the list of environment variables is reset, all prior assignments
        have no effect.</p>
<p>The names of the variables can contain ASCII letters, digits, and the underscore character.
        Variable names cannot be empty or start with a digit. In variable values, most characters are
        allowed, but non-printable characters are currently rejected.</p>
<p>Example:
        Environment="VAR1=word1 word2" VAR2=word3 "VAR3=$word 5 6"
        gives three variables VAR1,
        VAR2, VAR3
        with the values word1 word2,
        word3, $word 5 6.

    </a> for
        details about environment variables.</p>
<p>Note that environment variables are not suitable for passing secrets (such as passwords, key
        material, â€¦)  to service processes. Environment variables set for a unit are exposed to unprivileged
        clients via D-Bus IPC, and generally not understood as being data that requires protection. Moreover,
        environment variables are propagated down the process tree, including across security boundaries
        (such as setuid/setgid executables), and hence might leak to processes that should not have access to
        the secret data. Use <var>LoadCredential=</var>, <var>LoadCredentialEncrypted=</var>
        or <var>SetCredentialEncrypted=</var> (see below) to pass data to unit processes
        securely.</p>
