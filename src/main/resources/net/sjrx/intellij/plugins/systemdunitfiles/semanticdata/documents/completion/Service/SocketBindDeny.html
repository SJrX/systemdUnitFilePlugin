<p>Allow or deny binding a socket address to a socket by matching it with the bind-rule and
          applying a corresponding action if there is a match.</p>
<p>bind-rule describes socket properties such as address-family,
          transport-protocol and ip-ports.</p>
<p>bind-rule :=
          { [address-family:][transport-protocol:][ip-ports] | any }</p>
<p>address-family := { ipv4 | ipv6 }</p>
<p>transport-protocol := { tcp | udp }</p>
<p>ip-ports := { ip-port | ip-port-range }</p>
<p>An optional address-family expects ipv4 or ipv6 values.
          If not specified, a rule will be matched for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and applied depending on other socket fields, e.g. transport-protocol,
          ip-port.</p>
<p>An optional transport-protocol expects tcp or udp transport protocol names.
          If not specified, a rule will be matched for any transport protocol.</p>
<p>An optional ip-port value must lie within 1…65535 interval inclusively, i.e.
          dynamic port 0 is not allowed. A range of sequential ports is described by
          ip-port-range := ip-port-low-ip-port-high,
          where ip-port-low is smaller than or equal to ip-port-high
          and both are within 1…65535 inclusively.</p>
<p>A special value any can be used to apply a rule to any address family, transport protocol and any port with a positive value.</p>
<p>To allow multiple rules assign <var>SocketBindAllow=</var> or <var>SocketBindDeny=</var> multiple times.
          To clear the existing assignments pass an empty <var>SocketBindAllow=</var> or <var>SocketBindDeny=</var>
          assignment.</p>
<p>For each of <var>SocketBindAllow=</var> and <var>SocketBindDeny=</var>, maximum allowed number of assignments is
          128.</p>
<p>The feature is implemented with cgroup/bind4 and cgroup/bind6 cgroup-bpf hooks.</p>
<p>Examples:…
# Allow binding IPv6 socket addresses with a port greater than or equal to 10000.
[Service]
SocketBindAllow=ipv6:10000-65535
SocketBindDeny=any
…
# Allow binding IPv4 and IPv6 socket addresses with 1234 and 4321 ports.
[Service]
SocketBindAllow=1234
SocketBindAllow=4321
SocketBindDeny=any
…
# Deny binding IPv6 socket addresses.
[Service]
SocketBindDeny=ipv6
…
# Deny binding IPv4 and IPv6 socket addresses.
[Service]
SocketBindDeny=any
…
# Allow binding only over TCP
[Service]
SocketBindAllow=tcp
SocketBindDeny=any
…
# Allow binding only over IPv6/TCP
[Service]
SocketBindAllow=ipv6:tcp
SocketBindDeny=any
…
# Allow binding ports within 10000-65535 range over IPv4/UDP.
[Service]
SocketBindAllow=ipv4:udp:10000-65535
SocketBindDeny=any
