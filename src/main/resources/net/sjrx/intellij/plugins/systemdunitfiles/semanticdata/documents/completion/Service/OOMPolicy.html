<p>Configure the out-of-memory (OOM) kernel killer policy. Note that the userspace OOM
        killer
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-oomd.service.8.html">systemd-oomd.service(8)
    </a>
        is a more flexible solution that aims to prevent out-of-memory situations for the userspace, not just
        the kernel.</p>
<p>On Linux, when memory becomes scarce to the point that the kernel has trouble allocating memory
        for itself, it might decide to kill a running process in order to free up memory and reduce memory
        pressure. This setting takes one of continue, stop or
        kill. If set to continue and a process of the service is
        killed by the kernel's OOM killer this is logged but the service continues running. If set to
        stop the event is logged but the service is terminated cleanly by the service
        manager. If set to kill and one of the service's processes is killed by the OOM
        killer the kernel is instructed to kill all remaining processes of the service too, by setting the
        memory.oom.group attribute to 1; also see <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html">kernel documentation</a>.
        </p>
<p>Defaults to the setting <var>DefaultOOMPolicy=</var> in
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf(5)
    </a>
        is set to, except for services where <var>Delegate=</var> is turned on, where it defaults to
        continue.</p>
<p>Use the <var>OOMScoreAdjust=</var> setting to configure whether processes of the unit
        shall be considered preferred or less preferred candidates for process termination by the Linux OOM
        killer logic. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)
    </a> for
        details.</p>
<p>This setting also applies to systemd-oomd. Similarly to the kernel OOM
        kills, this setting determines the state of the service after systemd-oomd kills a
        cgroup associated with the service.</p>
