<p>Takes one of init, login or user. If
         <var>UtmpIdentifier=</var> is set, controls which type of <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/utmp.5.html">utmp(5)
    </a>/wtmp entries
         for this service are generated. This setting has no effect unless <var>UtmpIdentifier=</var> is set
         too. If init is set, only an INIT_PROCESS entry is generated and the
         invoked process must implement a getty-compatible utmp/wtmp logic. If
         login is set, first an INIT_PROCESS entry, followed by a
         LOGIN_PROCESS entry is generated. In this case, the invoked process must implement a
         <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/login.1.html">login(1)
    </a>-compatible
         utmp/wtmp logic. If user is set, first an INIT_PROCESS entry, then a
         LOGIN_PROCESS entry and finally a USER_PROCESS entry is
         generated. In this case, the invoked process may be any process that is suitable to be run as session
         leader. Defaults to init.</p>
