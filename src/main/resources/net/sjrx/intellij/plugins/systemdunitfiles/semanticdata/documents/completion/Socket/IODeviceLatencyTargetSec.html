<p>Set the per-device average target I/O latency for the executed processes, if the unified control group
          hierarchy is used on the system. Takes a file path and a timespan separated by a space to specify
          the device specific latency target. (Example: "/dev/sda 25ms"). The file path may be specified
          as path to a block device node or as any other file, in which case the backing block device of the file
          system of the file is determined. This controls the io.latency control group
          attribute. Use this option multiple times to set latency target for multiple devices. For details about this
          control group attribute, see <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#io-interface-files">IO Interface Files</a>.</p>
<p>Implies IOAccounting=yes.</p>
<p>These settings are supported only if the unified control group hierarchy is used.</p>
<p>Similar restrictions on block device discovery as for <var>IODeviceWeight=</var> apply, see above.</p>
