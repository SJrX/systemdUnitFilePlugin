<p>A space-separated list of URIs referencing
        documentation for this unit or its configuration. Accepted are
        only URIs of the types http://,
        https://, file:,
        info:, man:. For more
        information about the syntax of these URIs, see <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/uri.7.html">uri(7)
    </a>.
        The URIs should be listed in order of relevance, starting with
        the most relevant. It is a good idea to first reference
        documentation that explains what the unit's purpose is,
        followed by how it is configured, followed by any other
        related documentation. This option may be specified more than
        once, in which case the specified list of URIs is merged. If
        the empty string is assigned to this option, the list is reset
        and all prior assignments will have no
        effect.</p>
