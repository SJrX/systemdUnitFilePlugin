    </a> for
        details. If this refers to a device node, a dependency on the respective device unit is automatically
        created. (See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.device.5.html">systemd.device(5)
    </a>
        for more information.) If this refers to a file, a dependency on the respective mount unit is
        automatically created. (See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.mount.5.html">systemd.mount(5)
    </a> for
        more information.) This option is mandatory. Note that the usual specifier expansion is applied to
        this setting, literal percent characters should hence be written as
