<p>Takes one of noaccess, invisible,
        ptraceable or default (which it defaults to). When set, this
        controls the hidepid= mount option of the procfs instance for
        the unit that controls which directories with process metainformation
        (/proc/PID) are visible and accessible: when set to
        noaccess the ability to access most of other users' process metadata in
        /proc/ is taken away for processes of the service. When set to
        invisible processes owned by other users are hidden from
        /proc/. If ptraceable all processes that cannot be
        ptrace()'ed by a process are hidden to it. If default no
        restrictions on /proc/ access or visibility are made. For further details see
        <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/proc.html#mount-options">The /proc
        Filesystem</a>. It is generally recommended to run most system services with this option set to
        invisible. This option is implemented via file system namespacing, and thus cannot
        be used with services that shall be able to install mount points in the host file system
        hierarchy. Note that the root user is unaffected by this option, so to be effective it has to be used
        together with <var>User=</var> or <var>DynamicUser=yes</var>, and also without the
        CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability, which also allows a process to bypass this feature. It
        cannot be used for services that need to access metainformation about other users' processes. This
        option implies <var>MountAPIVFS=</var>.</p>
<p>If the kernel doesn't support per-mount point <var>hidepid=</var> mount options this
        setting remains without effect, and the unit's processes will be able to access and see other process
        as if the option was not used.</p>
