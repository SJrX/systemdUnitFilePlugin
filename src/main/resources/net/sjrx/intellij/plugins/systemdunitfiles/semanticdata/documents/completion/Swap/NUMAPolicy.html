<p>Controls the NUMA memory policy of the executed processes. Takes a policy type, one of:
        <var>default</var>, <var>preferred</var>, <var>bind</var>, <var>interleave</var> and
        <var>local</var>. A list of NUMA nodes that should be associated with the policy must be specified
        in <var>NUMAMask=</var>. For more details on each policy please see,
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/set_mempolicy.2.html">set_mempolicy(2)
    </a>. For overall
