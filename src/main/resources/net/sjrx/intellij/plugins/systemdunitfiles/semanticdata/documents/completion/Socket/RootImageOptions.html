<p>Takes a comma-separated list of mount options that will be used on disk images specified by
        <var>RootImage=</var>. Optionally a partition name can be prefixed, followed by colon, in
        case the image has multiple partitions, otherwise partition name root is implied.
        Options for multiple partitions can be specified in a single line with space separators. Assigning an empty
        string removes previous assignments. Duplicated options are ignored. For a list of valid mount options, please
        refer to
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)
    </a>.
        </p>
<p>Valid partition names follow the <a href="https://systemd.io/DISCOVERABLE_PARTITIONS">Discoverable Partitions Specification</a>:
        root, usr, home, srv,
        esp, xbootldr, tmp,
        var.</p>
