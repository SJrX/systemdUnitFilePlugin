<p>Takes a boolean argument. When true, systemd
         will attempt to figure out the SELinux label used for the
         instantiated service from the information handed by the peer
         over the network. Note that only the security level is used
         from the information provided by the peer. Other parts of the
         resulting SELinux context originate from either the target
         binary that is effectively triggered by socket unit or from
         the value of the <var>SELinuxContext=</var> option.
         This configuration option applies only when activated service
         is passed in single socket file descriptor, i.e. service
         instances that have standard input connected to a socket or
         services triggered by exactly one socket unit. Also note
         that this option is useful only when MLS/MCS SELinux policy
         is deployed. Defaults to
         false. </p>
