<p>Other than exact string matching (with = and !=),
          relative comparisons are supported for versioned parameters (e.g. VERSION_ID;
          with &lt;, &lt;=, ==,
          &lt;&gt;, &gt;=, &gt;), and shell-style
          wildcard comparisons (*, ?, []) are
          supported with the $= (match) and !$= (non-match).</p>
