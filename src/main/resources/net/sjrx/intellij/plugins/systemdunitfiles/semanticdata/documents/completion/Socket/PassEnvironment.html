<p>Pass environment variables set for the system service manager to executed processes. Takes a
        space-separated list of variable names. This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed
        variables will be passed. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of environment variables to
        pass is reset, all prior assignments have no effect. Variables specified that are not set for the system
        manager will not be passed and will be silently ignored. Note that this option is only relevant for the system
        service manager, as system services by default do not automatically inherit any environment variables set for
        the service manager itself. However, in case of the user service manager all environment variables are passed
        to the executed processes anyway, hence this option is without effect for the user service manager.</p>
<p>Variables set for invoked processes due to this setting are subject to being overridden by those
        configured with <var>Environment=</var> or <var>EnvironmentFile=</var>.</p>
<p>Example:
        PassEnvironment=VAR1 VAR2 VAR3
        passes three variables VAR1,
        VAR2, VAR3
        with the values set for those variables in PID1.</p>
