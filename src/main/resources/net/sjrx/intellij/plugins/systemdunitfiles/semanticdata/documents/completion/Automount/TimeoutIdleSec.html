<p>Configures an idle timeout. Once the mount has been
        idle for the specified time, systemd will attempt to unmount. Takes a
        unit-less value in seconds, or a time span value such as "5min 20s".
        Pass 0 to disable the timeout logic. The timeout is disabled by
        default.</p>
