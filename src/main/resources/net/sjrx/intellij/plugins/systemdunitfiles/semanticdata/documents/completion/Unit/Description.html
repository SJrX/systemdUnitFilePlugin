<p>A short human readable title of the unit. This may be used by
        systemd (and other UIs) as a user-visible label for the unit, so this string
        should identify the unit rather than describe it, despite the name. This string also shouldn't just
        repeat the unit name. Apache2 Web Server is a good example. Bad examples are
        high-performance light-weight HTTP server (too generic) or
        Apache2 (meaningless for people who do not know Apache, duplicates the unit
        name). systemd may use this string as a noun in status messages (Starting
        description..., Started
        description., Reached target
        description., Failed to start
        description.), so it should be capitalized, and should not be a
        full sentence, or a phrase with a continuous verb. Bad examples include exiting the
        container or updating the database once per day..</p>
