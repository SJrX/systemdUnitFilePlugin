<p>Takes a boolean value. Controls whether the socket can be bound to non-local IP
        addresses. This is useful to configure sockets listening on specific IP addresses before those IP
        addresses are successfully configured on a network interface. This sets the
        IP_FREEBIND/IPV6_FREEBIND socket option. For robustness
        reasons it is recommended to use this option whenever you bind a socket to a specific IP
        address. Defaults to <var>false</var>.</p>
