<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, sets up a new network namespace for the executed processes
        and configures only the loopback network device lo inside it. No other network devices will
        be available to the executed process. This is useful to turn off network access by the executed process.
        Defaults to false. It is possible to run two or more units within the same private network namespace by using
        the <var>JoinsNamespaceOf=</var> directive, see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)
    </a> for
        details. Note that this option will disconnect all socket families from the host, including
        AF_NETLINK and AF_UNIX. Effectively, for
        AF_NETLINK this means that device configuration events received from
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-udevd.service.8.html">systemd-udevd.service(8)
    </a> are
        not delivered to the unit's processes. And for AF_UNIX this has the effect that
        AF_UNIX sockets in the abstract socket namespace of the host will become unavailable to
        the unit's processes (however, those located in the file system will continue to be accessible).</p>
<p>Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if network namespaces are
        not available), and the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely on this setting for
        security.</p>
<p>When this option is used on a socket unit any sockets bound on behalf of this unit will be
        bound within a private network namespace. This may be combined with
        <var>JoinsNamespaceOf=</var> to listen on sockets inside of network namespaces of other
        services.</p>
