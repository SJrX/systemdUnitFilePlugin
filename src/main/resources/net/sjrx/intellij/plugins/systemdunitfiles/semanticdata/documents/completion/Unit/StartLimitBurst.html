<p>Configure unit start rate limiting. Units which are started more than
        burst times within an interval time span are
        not permitted to start any more. Use <var>StartLimitIntervalSec=</var> to configure the
        checking interval and <var>StartLimitBurst=</var> to configure how many starts per interval
        are allowed.</p>
<p>interval is a time span with the default unit of seconds, but other
        units may be specified, see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.time.5.html">systemd.time(5)
    </a>.
        Defaults to <var>DefaultStartLimitIntervalSec=</var> in manager configuration file, and may
        be set to 0 to disable any kind of rate limiting. burst is a number and
        defaults to <var>DefaultStartLimitBurst=</var> in manager configuration file.</p>
<p>These configuration options are particularly useful in conjunction with the service setting
        <var>Restart=</var> (see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)
    </a>);
        however, they apply to all kinds of starts (including manual), not just those triggered by the
        <var>Restart=</var> logic.</p>
<p>Note that units which are configured for <var>Restart=</var>, and which reach the start
        limit are not attempted to be restarted anymore; however, they may still be restarted manually or
        from a timer or socket at a later point, after the interval has passed.
        From that point on, the restart logic is activated again. systemctl reset-failed
        will cause the restart rate counter for a service to be flushed, which is useful if the administrator
        wants to manually start a unit and the start limit interferes with that. Rate-limiting is enforced
        after any unit condition checks are executed, and hence unit activations with failing conditions do
        not count towards the rate limit.</p>
<p>When a unit is unloaded due to the garbage collection logic (see above) its rate limit counters
        are flushed out too. This means that configuring start rate limiting for a unit that is not
        referenced continuously has no effect.</p>
<p>This setting does not apply to slice, target, device, and scope units, since they are unit
        types whose activation may either never fail, or may succeed only a single time.</p>
