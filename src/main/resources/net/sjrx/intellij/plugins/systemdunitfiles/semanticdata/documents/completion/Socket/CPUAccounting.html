<p>Turn on CPU usage accounting for this unit. Takes a
          boolean argument. Note that turning on CPU accounting for
          one unit will also implicitly turn it on for all units
          contained in the same slice and for all its parent slices
          and the units contained therein. The system default for this
          setting may be controlled with
          <var>DefaultCPUAccounting=</var> in
          <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf(5)
    </a>.</p>
