<p>Add custom network traffic filters implemented as BPF programs, applying to all IP packets
          sent and received over AF_INET and AF_INET6 sockets.
          Takes an absolute path to a pinned BPF program in the BPF virtual filesystem (/sys/fs/bpf/).
          </p>
<p>The filters configured with this option are applied to all sockets created by processes
          of this unit (or in the case of socket units, associated with it). The filters are loaded in addition
          to filters any of the parent slice units this unit might be a member of as well as any
          <var>IPAddressAllow=</var> and <var>IPAddressDeny=</var> filters in any of these units.
          By default there are no filters specified.</p>
<p>If these settings are used multiple times in the same unit all the specified programs are attached. If an
          empty string is assigned to these settings the program list is reset and all previous specified programs ignored.</p>
<p>If the path BPF_FS_PROGRAM_PATH in <var>IPIngressFilterPath=</var> assignment
          is already being handled by <var>BPFProgram=</var> ingress hook, e.g.
          <var>BPFProgram=</var>ingress:BPF_FS_PROGRAM_PATH,
          the assignment will be still considered valid and the program will be attached to a cgroup. Same for
          <var>IPEgressFilterPath=</var> path and egress hook.</p>
<p>Note that for socket-activated services, the IP filter programs configured on the socket unit apply to
          all sockets associated with it directly, but not to any sockets created by the ultimately activated services
          for it. Conversely, the IP filter programs configured for the service are not applied to any sockets passed into
          the service via socket activation. Thus, it is usually a good idea, to replicate the IP filter programs on both
          the socket and the service unit, however it often makes sense to maintain one configuration more open and the other
          one more restricted, depending on the usecase.</p>
<p>Note that these settings might not be supported on some systems (for example if eBPF control group
          support is not enabled in the underlying kernel or container manager). These settings will fail the service in
          that case. If compatibility with such systems is desired it is hence recommended to attach your filter manually
          (requires <var>Delegate=</var>yes) instead of using this setting.</p>
