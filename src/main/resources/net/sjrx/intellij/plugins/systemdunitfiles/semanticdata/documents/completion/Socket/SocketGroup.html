<p>Takes a UNIX user/group name. When specified, all AF_UNIX
        sockets and FIFO nodes in the file system are owned by the specified user and group. If unset (the
        default), the nodes are owned by the root user/group (if run in system context) or the invoking
        user/group (if run in user context).  If only a user is specified but no group, then the group is
        derived from the user's default group.</p>
