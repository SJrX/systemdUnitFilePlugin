<p>Sets the supplementary Unix groups the processes are executed as. This takes a space-separated
        list of group names or IDs. This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed groups are
        set as supplementary groups. When the empty string is assigned, the list of supplementary groups is reset, and
        all assignments prior to this one will have no effect. In any way, this option does not override, but extends
        the list of supplementary groups configured in the system group database for the user. This does not affect
        commands prefixed with +.</p>
