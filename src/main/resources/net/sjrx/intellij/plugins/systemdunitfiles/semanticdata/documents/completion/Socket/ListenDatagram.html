<p>Specifies an address to listen on for a stream
        (SOCK_STREAM), datagram
        (SOCK_DGRAM), or sequential packet
        (SOCK_SEQPACKET) socket, respectively.
        The address can be written in various formats:</p>
<p>If the address starts with a slash
        (/), it is read as file system socket in
        the AF_UNIX socket family.</p>
<p>If the address starts with an at symbol
        (@), it is read as abstract namespace
        socket in the AF_UNIX family. The
        @ is replaced with a
        NUL character before binding. For
        details, see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/unix.7.html">unix(7)
    </a>.</p>
<p>If the address string is a single number, it is read as
        port number to listen on via IPv6. Depending on the value of
        <var>BindIPv6Only=</var> (see below) this might result
        in the service being available via both IPv6 and IPv4
        (default) or just via IPv6.
        </p>
<p>If the address string is a string in the format
        v.w.x.y:z, it is interpreted
        as IPv4 address v.w.x.y and port z.</p>
<p>If the address string is a string in the format
        [x]:y, it is interpreted as
        IPv6 address x and port y. An optional
        interface scope (interface name or number) may be specified after a % symbol:
        [x]:y%dev.
        Interface scopes are only useful with link-local addresses, because the kernel ignores them in other
        cases. Note that if an address is specified as IPv6, it might still make the service available via
        IPv4 too, depending on the <var>BindIPv6Only=</var> setting (see below).</p>
<p>If the address string is a string in the format
        vsock:x:y, it is read as CID
        x on a port y address in the
        AF_VSOCK family.  The CID is a unique 32-bit integer identifier in
        AF_VSOCK analogous to an IP address.  Specifying the CID is optional, and may be
        set to the empty string.</p>
<p>Note that SOCK_SEQPACKET (i.e.
        <var>ListenSequentialPacket=</var>) is only available
        for AF_UNIX sockets.
        SOCK_STREAM (i.e.
        <var>ListenStream=</var>) when used for IP sockets
        refers to TCP sockets, SOCK_DGRAM (i.e.
        <var>ListenDatagram=</var>) to UDP.</p>
<p>These options may be specified more than once, in which
        case incoming traffic on any of the sockets will trigger
        service activation, and all listed sockets will be passed to
        the service, regardless of whether there is incoming traffic
        on them or not. If the empty string is assigned to any of
        these options, the list of addresses to listen on is reset,
        all prior uses of any of these options will have no
        effect.</p>
<p>It is also possible to have more than one socket unit
        for the same service when using <var>Service=</var>,
        and the service will receive all the sockets configured in all
        the socket units. Sockets configured in one unit are passed in
        the order of configuration, but no ordering between socket
        units is specified.</p>
<p>If an IP address is used here, it is often desirable to
        listen on it before the interface it is configured on is up
        and running, and even regardless of whether it will be up and
        running at any point. To deal with this, it is recommended to
        set the <var>FreeBind=</var> option described
        below.</p>
