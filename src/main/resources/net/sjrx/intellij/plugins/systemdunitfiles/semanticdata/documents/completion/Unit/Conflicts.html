<p>A space-separated list of unit names. Configures negative requirement
        dependencies. If a unit has a <var>Conflicts=</var> setting on another unit, starting the
        former will stop the latter and vice versa.</p>
<p>Note that this setting does not imply an ordering dependency, similarly to the
        <var>Wants=</var> and <var>Requires=</var> dependencies described above. This means
        that to ensure that the conflicting unit is stopped before the other unit is started, an
        <var>After=</var> or <var>Before=</var> dependency must be declared. It doesn't
        matter which of the two ordering dependencies is used, because stop jobs are always ordered before
        start jobs, see the discussion in <var>Before=</var>/<var>After=</var> below.</p>
<p>If unit A that conflicts with unit B is scheduled to
        be started at the same time as B, the transaction will either
        fail (in case both are required parts of the transaction) or be
        modified to be fixed (in case one or both jobs are not a
        required part of the transaction). In the latter case, the job
        that is not required will be removed, or in case both are
        not required, the unit that conflicts will be started and the
        unit that is conflicted is stopped.</p>
