<p>Configures whether the service shall be
        restarted when the service process exits, is killed, or a
        timeout is reached. The service process may be the main
        service process, but it may also be one of the processes
        specified with <var>ExecStartPre=</var>,
        <var>ExecStartPost=</var>,
        <var>ExecStop=</var>,
        <var>ExecStopPost=</var>, or
        <var>ExecReload=</var>. When the death of the process
        is a result of systemd operation (e.g. service stop or
        restart), the service will not be restarted. Timeouts include
        missing the watchdog "keep-alive ping" deadline and a service
        start, reload, and stop operation timeouts.</p>
<p>Takes one of
        <var>no</var>,
        <var>on-success</var>,
        <var>on-failure</var>,
        <var>on-abnormal</var>,
        <var>on-watchdog</var>,
        <var>on-abort</var>, or
        <var>always</var>.
        If set to <var>no</var> (the default), the service will
        not be restarted. If set to <var>on-success</var>, it
        will be restarted only when the service process exits cleanly.
        In this context, a clean exit means any of the following:
        
            exit code of 0;
            for types other than
            <var>Type=oneshot</var>, one of the signals
                SIGHUP,
                SIGINT,
                SIGTERM, or
                SIGPIPE;
            exit statuses and signals specified in
                <var>SuccessExitStatus=</var>.
        
        If set to
        <var>on-failure</var>, the service will be restarted
        when the process exits with a non-zero exit code, is
        terminated by a signal (including on core dump, but excluding
        the aforementioned four signals), when an operation (such as
        service reload) times out, and when the configured watchdog
        timeout is triggered. If set to <var>on-abnormal</var>,
        the service will be restarted when the process is terminated
        by a signal (including on core dump, excluding the
        aforementioned four signals), when an operation times out, or
        when the watchdog timeout is triggered. If set to
        <var>on-abort</var>, the service will be restarted only
        if the service process exits due to an uncaught signal not
        specified as a clean exit status. If set to
        <var>on-watchdog</var>, the service will be restarted
        only if the watchdog timeout for the service expires. If set
        to <var>always</var>, the service will be restarted
        regardless of whether it exited cleanly or not, got terminated
        abnormally by a signal, or hit a timeout.</p>
<p>As exceptions to the setting above, the service will not
        be restarted if the exit code or signal is specified in
        <var>RestartPreventExitStatus=</var> (see below) or
        the service is stopped with systemctl stop
        or an equivalent operation. Also, the services will always be
        restarted if the exit code or signal is specified in
        <var>RestartForceExitStatus=</var> (see below).</p>
<p>Note that service restart is subject to unit start rate
        limiting configured with <var>StartLimitIntervalSec=</var>
        and <var>StartLimitBurst=</var>, see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)
    </a>
        for details.  A restarted service enters the failed state only
        after the start limits are reached.</p>
<p>Setting this to <var>on-failure</var> is the
        recommended choice for long-running services, in order to
        increase reliability by attempting automatic recovery from
        errors. For services that shall be able to terminate on their
        own choice (and avoid immediate restarting),
        <var>on-abnormal</var> is an alternative choice.</p>
