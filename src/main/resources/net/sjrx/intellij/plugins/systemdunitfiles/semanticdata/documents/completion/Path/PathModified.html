<p>Defines paths to monitor for certain changes:
        <var>PathExists=</var> may be used to watch the mere
        existence of a file or directory. If the file specified
        exists, the configured unit is activated.
        <var>PathExistsGlob=</var> works similarly, but checks
        for the existence of at least one file matching the globbing
        pattern specified. <var>PathChanged=</var> may be used
        to watch a file or directory and activate the configured unit
        whenever it changes. It is not activated on every write to the
        watched file but it is activated if the file which was open
        for writing gets closed. <var>PathModified=</var> is
        similar, but additionally it is activated also on simple
        writes to the watched file.
        <var>DirectoryNotEmpty=</var> may be used to watch a
        directory and activate the configured unit whenever it
        contains at least one file.</p>
<p>The arguments of these directives must be absolute file
        system paths.</p>
<p>Multiple directives may be combined, of the same and of
        different types, to watch multiple paths. If the empty string
        is assigned to any of these options, the list of paths to
        watch is reset, and any prior assignments of these options
        will not have any effect.</p>
<p>If a path already exists (in case of
        <var>PathExists=</var> and
        <var>PathExistsGlob=</var>) or a directory already is
        not empty (in case of <var>DirectoryNotEmpty=</var>)
        at the time the path unit is activated, then the configured
        unit is immediately activated as well. Something similar does
        not apply to <var>PathChanged=</var> and
        <var>PathModified=</var>.</p>
<p>If the path itself or any of the containing directories
        are not accessible, systemd will watch for
        permission changes and notice that conditions are satisfied
        when permissions allow that. </p>
