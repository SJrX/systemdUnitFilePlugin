<p><var>ConditionPathIsEncrypted=</var> is similar to
          <var>ConditionPathExists=</var> but verifies that the underlying file system's backing
          block device is encrypted using dm-crypt/LUKS. Note that this check does not cover ext4
          per-directory encryption, and only detects block level encryption. Moreover, if the specified path
          resides on a file system on top of a loopback block device, only encryption above the loopback device is
          detected. It is not detected whether the file system backing the loopback block device is encrypted.</p>
