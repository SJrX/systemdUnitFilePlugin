<p>Configures dependencies similar to
        <var>Requires=</var>, but limited to stopping and
        restarting of units. When systemd stops or restarts the units
        listed here, the action is propagated to this unit. Note that
        this is a one-way dependency — changes to this unit do not
        affect the listed units.</p>
<p>When <var>PartOf=b.service</var> is used on
        a.service, this dependency will show as
        <var>ConsistsOf=a.service</var> in property listing of
        b.service. <var>ConsistsOf=</var>
        dependency cannot be specified directly.</p>
