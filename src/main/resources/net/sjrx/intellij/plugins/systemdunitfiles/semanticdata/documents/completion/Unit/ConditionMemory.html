<p>Verify that the specified amount of system memory is available to the current
          system. Takes a memory size in bytes as argument, optionally prefixed with a comparison operator
          &lt;, &lt;=, = (or ==),
          != (or &lt;&gt;), &gt;=,
          &gt;. On bare-metal systems compares the amount of physical memory in the system
          with the specified size, adhering to the specified comparison operator. In containers compares the
          amount of memory assigned to the container instead.</p>
