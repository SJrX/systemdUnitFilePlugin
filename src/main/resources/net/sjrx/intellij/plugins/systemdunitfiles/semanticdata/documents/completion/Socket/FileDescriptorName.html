<p>Assigns a name to all file descriptors this
        socket unit encapsulates. This is useful to help activated
        services identify specific file descriptors, if multiple fds
        are passed. Services may use the
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd_listen_fds_with_names.3.html">sd_listen_fds_with_names(3)
    </a>
        call to acquire the names configured for the received file
        descriptors. Names may contain any ASCII character, but must
        exclude control characters and :, and must
        be at most 255 characters in length. If this setting is not
        used, the file descriptor name defaults to the name of the
        socket unit, including its .socket
        suffix.</p>
