<p>Controls the CPU affinity of the executed processes. Takes a list of CPU indices or ranges
        separated by either whitespace or commas. Alternatively, takes a special "numa" value in which case systemd
        automatically derives allowed CPU range based on the value of <var>NUMAMask=</var> option. CPU ranges
        are specified by the lower and upper CPU indices separated by a dash. This option may be specified more than
        once, in which case the specified CPU affinity masks are merged. If the empty string is assigned, the mask
        is reset, all assignments prior to this will have no effect. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setaffinity.2.html">sched_setaffinity(2)
    </a> for
        details.</p>
