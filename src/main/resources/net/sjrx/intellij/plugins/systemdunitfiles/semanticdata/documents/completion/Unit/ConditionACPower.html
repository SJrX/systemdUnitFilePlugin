<p>Check whether the system has AC power, or is exclusively battery powered at the
          time of activation of the unit. This takes a boolean argument. If set to true,
          the condition will hold only if at least one AC connector of the system is connected to a power
          source, or if no AC connectors are known. Conversely, if set to false, the
          condition will hold only if there is at least one AC connector known and all AC connectors are
          disconnected from a power source.</p>
