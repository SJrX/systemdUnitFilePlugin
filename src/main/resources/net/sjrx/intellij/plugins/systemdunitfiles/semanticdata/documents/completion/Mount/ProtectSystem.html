<p>Takes a boolean argument or the special values full or
        strict. If true, mounts the /usr/ and the boot loader
        directories (/boot and /efi) read-only for processes
        invoked by this unit. If set to full, the /etc/ directory is
        mounted read-only, too. If set to strict the entire file system hierarchy is
        mounted read-only, except for the API file system subtrees /dev/,
        /proc/ and /sys/ (protect these directories using
        <var>PrivateDevices=</var>, <var>ProtectKernelTunables=</var>,
        <var>ProtectControlGroups=</var>). This setting ensures that any modification of the vendor-supplied
        operating system (and optionally its configuration, and local mounts) is prohibited for the service. It is
        recommended to enable this setting for all long-running services, unless they are involved with system updates
        or need to modify the operating system in other ways. If this option is used,
        <var>ReadWritePaths=</var> may be used to exclude specific directories from being made read-only. This
        setting is implied if <var>DynamicUser=</var> is set. This setting cannot ensure protection in all
        cases. In general it has the same limitations as <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var>, see below. Defaults to
        off.</p>
