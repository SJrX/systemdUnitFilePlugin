<p>Takes a space-separated list of mount points for temporary file systems (tmpfs). If set, a new file
        system namespace is set up for executed processes, and a temporary file system is mounted on each mount point.
        This option may be specified more than once, in which case temporary file systems are mounted on all listed mount
        points. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list is reset, and all prior assignments have no effect.
        Each mount point may optionally be suffixed with a colon (:) and mount options such as
        size=10% or ro. By default, each temporary file system is mounted
        with nodev,strictatime,mode=0755. These can be disabled by explicitly specifying the corresponding
        mount options, e.g., dev or nostrictatime.</p>
<p>This is useful to hide files or directories not relevant to the processes invoked by the unit, while necessary
        files or directories can be still accessed by combining with <var>BindPaths=</var> or
        <var>BindReadOnlyPaths=</var>:</p>
<p>Example: if a unit has the following,
        TemporaryFileSystem=/var:ro
BindReadOnlyPaths=/var/lib/systemd
        then the invoked processes by the unit cannot see any files or directories under /var/ except for
        /var/lib/systemd or its contents.</p>
