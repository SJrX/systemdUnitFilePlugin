<p>Takes a boolean parameter. If set, the processes of this unit will be run in their own private
        file system (mount) namespace with all mount propagation from the processes towards the host's main file system
        namespace turned off. This means any file system mount points established or removed by the unit's processes
        will be private to them and not be visible to the host. However, file system mount points established or
        removed on the host will be propagated to the unit's processes. See <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces(7)
    </a> for
        details on file system namespaces. Defaults to off.</p>
<p>When turned on, this executes three operations for each invoked process: a new
        CLONE_NEWNS namespace is created, after which all existing mounts are remounted to
        MS_SLAVE to disable propagation from the unit's processes to the host (but leaving
        propagation in the opposite direction in effect). Finally, the mounts are remounted again to the propagation
        mode configured with <var>MountFlags=</var>, see below.</p>
<p>File system namespaces are set up individually for each process forked off by the service manager. Mounts
        established in the namespace of the process created by <var>ExecStartPre=</var> will hence be cleaned
        up automatically as soon as that process exits and will not be available to subsequent processes forked off for
        <var>ExecStart=</var> (and similar applies to the various other commands configured for
        units). Similarly, <var>JoinsNamespaceOf=</var> does not permit sharing kernel mount namespaces between
        units, it only enables sharing of the /tmp/ and /var/tmp/
        directories.</p>
<p>Other file system namespace unit settings — <var>PrivateMounts=</var>,
        <var>PrivateTmp=</var>, <var>PrivateDevices=</var>, <var>ProtectSystem=</var>,
        <var>ProtectHome=</var>, <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var>, <var>InaccessiblePaths=</var>,
        <var>ReadWritePaths=</var>, … — also enable file system namespacing in a fashion equivalent to this
        option. Hence it is primarily useful to explicitly request this behaviour if none of the other settings are
        used.</p>
