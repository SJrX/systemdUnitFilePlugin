<p>Configures requirement dependencies, very similar in style to
        <var>Requires=</var>. However, this dependency type is stronger: in addition to the effect of
        <var>Requires=</var> it declares that if the unit bound to is stopped, this unit will be stopped
        too. This means a unit bound to another unit that suddenly enters inactive state will be stopped too.
        Units can suddenly, unexpectedly enter inactive state for different reasons: the main process of a service unit
        might terminate on its own choice, the backing device of a device unit might be unplugged or the mount point of
        a mount unit might be unmounted without involvement of the system and service manager.</p>
<p>When used in conjunction with <var>After=</var> on the same unit the behaviour of
        <var>BindsTo=</var> is even stronger. In this case, the unit bound to strictly has to be in active
        state for this unit to also be in active state. This not only means a unit bound to another unit that suddenly
        enters inactive state, but also one that is bound to another unit that gets skipped due to an unmet condition
        check (such as <var>ConditionPathExists=</var>, <var>ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=</var>, … —
        see below) will be stopped, should it be running. Hence, in many cases it is best to combine
        <var>BindsTo=</var> with <var>After=</var>.</p>
<p>When <var>BindsTo=b.service</var> is used on
        a.service, this dependency will show as
        <var>BoundBy=a.service</var> in property listing of
        b.service. <var>BoundBy=</var>
        dependency cannot be specified directly.</p>
