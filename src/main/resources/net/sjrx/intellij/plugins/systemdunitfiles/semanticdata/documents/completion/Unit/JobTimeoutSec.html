<p><var>JobTimeoutSec=</var> specifies a timeout for the whole job that starts
        running when the job is queued. <var>JobRunningTimeoutSec=</var> specifies a timeout that
        starts running when the queued job is actually started. If either limit is reached, the job will be
        cancelled, the unit however will not change state or even enter the failed mode.
        </p>
<p>Both settings take a time span with the default unit of seconds, but other units may be
        specified, see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.time.5.html">systemd.time(5)
    </a>.
        The default is infinity (job timeouts disabled), except for device units where
        <var>JobRunningTimeoutSec=</var> defaults to <var>DefaultTimeoutStartSec=</var>.
        </p>
<p>Note: these timeouts are independent from any unit-specific timeouts (for example, the timeout
        set with <var>TimeoutStartSec=</var> in service units). The job timeout has no effect on the
        unit itself. Or in other words: unit-specific timeouts are useful to abort unit state changes, and
        revert them. The job timeout set with this option however is useful to abort only the job waiting for
        the unit state to change.</p>
