<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, an elapsing timer will cause the system to resume
        from suspend, should it be suspended and if the system supports this. Note that this option will only
        make sure the system resumes on the appropriate times, it will not take care of suspending it again
        after any work that is to be done is finished. Defaults to
        <var>false</var>.</p>
<p>Note that this functionality requires privileges and is thus generally only available in the
        system service manager.</p>
<p>Note that behaviour of monotonic clock timers (as configured with
        <var>OnActiveSec=</var>, <var>OnBootSec=</var>, <var>OnStartupSec=</var>,
        <var>OnUnitActiveSec=</var>, <var>OnUnitInactiveSec=</var>, see above) is altered
        depending on this option. If false, a monotonic clock is used that is paused during system suspend
        (CLOCK_MONOTONIC), if true a different monotonic clock is used that continues
        advancing during system suspend (CLOCK_BOOTTIME), see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_getres.2.html">clock_getres(2)
    </a> for
        details.</p>
