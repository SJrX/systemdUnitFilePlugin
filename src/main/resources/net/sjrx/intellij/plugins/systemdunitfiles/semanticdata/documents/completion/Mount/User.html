<p>Set the UNIX user or group that the processes are executed as, respectively. Takes a single
        user or group name, or a numeric ID as argument. For system services (services run by the system service
        manager, i.e. managed by PID 1) and for user services of the root user (services managed by root's instance of
        systemd --user), the default is root, but <var>User=</var> may be
        used to specify a different user. For user services of any other user, switching user identity is not
        permitted, hence the only valid setting is the same user the user's service manager is running as. If no group
        is set, the default group of the user is used. This setting does not affect commands whose command line is
        prefixed with +.</p>
<p>Note that this enforces only weak restrictions on the user/group name syntax, but will generate
        warnings in many cases where user/group names do not adhere to the following rules: the specified
        name should consist only of the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ and
        -, except for the first character which must be one of a-z, A-Z and
        _ (i.e. digits and - are not permitted as first character). The
        user/group name must have at least one character, and at most 31. These restrictions are made in
        order to avoid ambiguities and to ensure user/group names and unit files remain portable among Linux
        systems. For further details on the names accepted and the names warned about see <a href="https://systemd.io/USER_NAMES">User/Group Name Syntax</a>.</p>
<p>When used in conjunction with <var>DynamicUser=</var> the user/group name specified is
        dynamically allocated at the time the service is started, and released at the time the service is
        stopped â€” unless it is already allocated statically (see below). If <var>DynamicUser=</var>
        is not used the specified user and group must have been created statically in the user database no
        later than the moment the service is started, for example using the
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sysusers.d.5.html">sysusers.d(5)
    </a>
        facility, which is applied at boot or package install time. If the user does not exist by then
        program invocation will fail.</p>
<p>If the <var>User=</var> setting is used the supplementary group list is initialized
        from the specified user's default group list, as defined in the system's user and group
        database. Additional groups may be configured through the <var>SupplementaryGroups=</var>
        setting (see below).</p>
