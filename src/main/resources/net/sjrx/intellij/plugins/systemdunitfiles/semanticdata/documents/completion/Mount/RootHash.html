<p>Takes a data integrity (dm-verity) root hash specified in hexadecimal, or the path to a file
        containing a root hash in ASCII hexadecimal format. This option enables data integrity checks using dm-verity,
        if the used image contains the appropriate integrity data (see above) or if <var>RootVerity=</var> is used.
        The specified hash must match the root hash of integrity data, and is usually at least 256 bits (and hence 64
        formatted hexadecimal characters) long (in case of SHA256 for example). If this option is not specified, but
        the image file carries the user.verity.roothash extended file attribute (see <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/xattr.7.html">xattr(7)
    </a>), then the root
        hash is read from it, also as formatted hexadecimal characters. If the extended file attribute is not found (or
        is not supported by the underlying file system), but a file with the .roothash suffix is
        found next to the image file, bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the
        .raw suffix, in which case the root hash file must not have it in its name), the root hash
        is read from it and automatically used, also as formatted hexadecimal characters.</p>
<p>If the disk image contains a separate /usr/ partition it may also be
        Verity protected, in which case the root hash may configured via an extended attribute
        user.verity.usrhash or a .usrhash file adjacent to the disk
        image. There's currently no option to configure the root hash for the /usr/ file
        system via the unit file directly.</p>
