<p>Controls how the kernel session keyring is set up for the service (see <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/session-keyring.7.html">session-keyring(7)
    </a> for
        details on the session keyring). Takes one of <var>inherit</var>, <var>private</var>,
        <var>shared</var>. If set to <var>inherit</var> no special keyring setup is done, and the kernel's
        default behaviour is applied. If <var>private</var> is used a new session keyring is allocated when a
        service process is invoked, and it is not linked up with any user keyring. This is the recommended setting for
        system services, as this ensures that multiple services running under the same system user ID (in particular
        the root user) do not share their key material among each other. If <var>shared</var> is used a new
        session keyring is allocated as for <var>private</var>, but the user keyring of the user configured with
        <var>User=</var> is linked into it, so that keys assigned to the user may be requested by the unit's
        processes. In this modes multiple units running processes under the same user ID may share key material. Unless
        <var>inherit</var> is selected the unique invocation ID for the unit (see below) is added as a protected
        key by the name invocation_id to the newly created session keyring. Defaults to
        <var>private</var> for services of the system service manager and to <var>inherit</var> for
        non-service units and for services of the user service manager.</p>
