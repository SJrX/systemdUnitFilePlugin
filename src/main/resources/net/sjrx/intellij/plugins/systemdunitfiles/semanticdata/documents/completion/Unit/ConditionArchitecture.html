<p>Check whether the system is running on a specific architecture. Takes one of

<p>The architecture is determined from the information returned by
          <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/uname.2.html">uname(2)
    </a>
          and is thus subject to
          <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/personality.2.html">personality(2)
    </a>.
          Note that a <var>Personality=</var> setting in the same unit file has no effect on this
          condition. A special architecture name native is mapped to the architecture the
          system manager itself is compiled for. The test may be negated by prepending an exclamation
          mark.</p>
