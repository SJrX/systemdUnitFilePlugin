<p>Specifies a file system FIFO (see <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/fifo.7.html">fifo(7)
    </a> for
        details) to listen on.  This expects an absolute file system path as argument.  Behavior otherwise is
        very similar to the <var>ListenDatagram=</var> directive above.</p>
