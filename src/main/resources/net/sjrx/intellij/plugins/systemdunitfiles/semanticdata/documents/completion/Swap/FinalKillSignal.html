<p>Specifies which signal to send to remaining
        processes after a timeout if <var>SendSIGKILL=</var>
        is enabled. The signal configured here should be one that is
        not typically caught and processed by services (SIGTERM
        is not suitable). Developers can find it useful to use this to
        generate a coredump to troubleshoot why a service did not
        terminate upon receiving the initial SIGTERM
        signal. This can be achieved by configuring <var>LimitCORE=</var>
        and setting <var>FinalKillSignal=</var> to either
        SIGQUIT or SIGABRT.
        Defaults to SIGKILL.
