<p>Controls where file descriptor 1 (stdout) of the executed processes is connected
        to. Takes one of <var>inherit</var>, <var>null</var>, <var>tty</var>,
        <var>journal</var>, <var>kmsg</var>, <var>journal+console</var>,
        <var>kmsg+console</var>, <var>file:path</var>,
        <var>append:path</var>, <var>truncate:path</var>,
        <var>socket</var> or <var>fd:name</var>.</p>
<p><var>inherit</var> duplicates the file descriptor of standard input for standard output.</p>
<p><var>null</var> connects standard output to /dev/null, i.e. everything written
        to it will be lost.</p>
<p><var>tty</var> connects standard output to a tty (as configured via <var>TTYPath=</var>,
        see below). If the TTY is used for output only, the executed process will not become the controlling process of
        the terminal, and will not fail or wait for other processes to release the terminal.</p>
<p><var>journal</var> connects standard output with the journal, which is accessible via
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)
    </a>. Note
        that everything that is written to kmsg (see below) is implicitly stored in the journal as well, the
        specific option listed below is hence a superset of this one. (Also note that any external,
        additional syslog daemons receive their log data from the journal, too, hence this is the option to
        use when logging shall be processed with such a daemon.)</p>
<p><var>kmsg</var> connects standard output with the kernel log buffer which is accessible via
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html">dmesg(1)
    </a>,
        in addition to the journal. The journal daemon might be configured to send all logs to kmsg anyway, in which
        case this option is no different from <var>journal</var>.</p>
<p><var>journal+console</var> and <var>kmsg+console</var> work in a similar way as the
        two options above but copy the output to the system console as well.</p>
<p>The <var>file:path</var> option may be used to connect a specific file
        system object to standard output. The semantics are similar to the same option of
        <var>StandardInput=</var>, see above. If path refers to a regular file
        on the filesystem, it is opened (created if it doesn't exist yet) for writing at the beginning of the file,
        but without truncating it.
        If standard input and output are directed to the same file path, it is opened only once — for reading as well
        as writing — and duplicated. This is particularly useful when the specified path refers to an
        AF_UNIX socket in the file system, as in that case only a
        single stream connection is created for both input and output.</p>
<p><var>append:path</var> is similar to
        <var>file:path</var> above, but it opens the file in append mode.
        </p>
<p><var>truncate:path</var> is similar to
        <var>file:path</var> above, but it truncates the file when opening
        it. For units with multiple command lines, e.g. <var>Type=oneshot</var> services with
        multiple <var>ExecStart=</var>, or services with <var>ExecCondition=</var>,
        <var>ExecStartPre=</var> or <var>ExecStartPost=</var>, the output file is reopened
        and therefore re-truncated for each command line. If the output file is truncated while another
        process still has the file open, e.g. by an <var>ExecReload=</var> running concurrently with
        an <var>ExecStart=</var>, and the other process continues writing to the file without
        adjusting its offset, then the space between the file pointers of the two processes may be filled
        with NUL bytes, producing a sparse file. Thus,
        <var>truncate:path</var> is typically only useful for units where
        only one process runs at a time, such as services with a single <var>ExecStart=</var> and no
        <var>ExecStartPost=</var>, <var>ExecReload=</var>, <var>ExecStop=</var> or
        similar.</p>
<p><var>socket</var> connects standard output to a socket acquired via socket activation. The
        semantics are similar to the same option of <var>StandardInput=</var>, see above.</p>
<p>The <var>fd:name</var> option connects standard output to a
        specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit. A name may be specified as part of this
        option, following a : character
        (e.g. fd:foobar). If no name is specified, the name
        stdout is implied (i.e. fd is equivalent to
        fd:stdout). At least one socket unit defining the specified name must be provided
        via the <var>Sockets=</var> option, and the file descriptor name may differ from the name of
        its containing socket unit. If multiple matches are found, the first one will be used. See
        <var>FileDescriptorName=</var> in
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.socket.5.html">systemd.socket(5)
    </a>
        for more details about named descriptors and their ordering.</p>
<p>If the standard output (or error output, see below) of a unit is connected to the journal or
        the kernel log buffer, the unit will implicitly gain a dependency of type <var>After=</var>
        on systemd-journald.socket (also see the "Implicit Dependencies" section
        above). Also note that in this case stdout (or stderr, see below) will be an
        AF_UNIX stream socket, and not a pipe or FIFO that can be re-opened. This means
        when executing shell scripts the construct echo "hello" &gt; /dev/stderr for
        writing text to stderr will not work. To mitigate this use the construct echo "hello"
        &gt;&amp;2 instead, which is mostly equivalent and avoids this pitfall.</p>
<p>If <var>StandardInput=</var> is set to one of <var>tty</var>, <var>tty-force</var>,
        <var>tty-fail</var>, <var>socket</var>, or <var>fd:name</var>, this
        setting defaults to <var>inherit</var>.</p>
<p>In other cases, this setting defaults to the value set with <var>DefaultStandardOutput=</var> in
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf(5)
    </a>, which
        defaults to <var>journal</var>. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies
        to be added to the unit (see above).</p>
