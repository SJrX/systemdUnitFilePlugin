<p>Disables controllers from being enabled for a unit's children. If a controller listed is already in use
          in its subtree, the controller will be removed from the subtree. This can be used to avoid child units being
          able to implicitly or explicitly enable a controller. Defaults to not disabling any controllers.</p>
<p>It may not be possible to successfully disable a controller if the unit or any child of the unit in
          question delegates controllers to its children, as any delegated subtree of the cgroup hierarchy is unmanaged
          by systemd.</p>
<p>Multiple controllers may be specified, separated by spaces. You may also pass
          <var>DisableControllers=</var> multiple times, in which case each new instance adds another controller
          to disable. Passing <var>DisableControllers=</var> by itself with no controller name present resets
          the disabled controller list.</p>
