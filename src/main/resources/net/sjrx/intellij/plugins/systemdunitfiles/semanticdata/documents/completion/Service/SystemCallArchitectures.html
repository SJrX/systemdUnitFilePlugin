<p>Takes a space-separated list of architecture identifiers to include in the system call
        filter. The known architecture identifiers are the same as for <var>ConditionArchitecture=</var>
        described in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)
    </a>,
        as well as x32, mips64-n32, mips64-le-n32, and
        the special identifier native. The special identifier native
        implicitly maps to the native architecture of the system (or more precisely: to the architecture the system
        manager is compiled for). If running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the
        CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting <var>User=</var>),
        <var>NoNewPrivileges=yes</var> is implied. By default, this option is set to the empty list, i.e. no
        filtering is applied.</p>
<p>If this setting is used, processes of this unit will only be permitted to call native system calls, and
        system calls of the specified architectures. For the purposes of this option, the x32 architecture is treated
        as including x86-64 system calls. However, this setting still fulfills its purpose, as explained below, on
        x32.</p>
<p>System call filtering is not equally effective on all architectures. For example, on x86
        filtering of network socket-related calls is not possible, due to ABI limitations — a limitation that x86-64
        does not have, however. On systems supporting multiple ABIs at the same time — such as x86/x86-64 — it is hence
        recommended to limit the set of permitted system call architectures so that secondary ABIs may not be used to
        circumvent the restrictions applied to the native ABI of the system. In particular, setting
        <var>SystemCallArchitectures=native</var> is a good choice for disabling non-native ABIs.</p>
<p>System call architectures may also be restricted system-wide via the
        <var>SystemCallArchitectures=</var> option in the global configuration. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf(5)
    </a> for
        details.</p>
