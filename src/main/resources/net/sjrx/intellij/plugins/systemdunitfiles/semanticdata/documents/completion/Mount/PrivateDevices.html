<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, sets up a new /dev/ mount for
        the executed processes and only adds API pseudo devices such as /dev/null,
        /dev/zero or /dev/random (as well as the pseudo TTY
        subsystem) to it, but no physical devices such as /dev/sda, system memory
        /dev/mem, system ports /dev/port and others. This is useful
        to turn off physical device access by the executed process. Defaults to false.</p>
<p>Enabling this option will install a system call filter to block low-level I/O system calls that
        are grouped in the <var>@raw-io</var> set, remove CAP_MKNOD and
        CAP_SYS_RAWIO from the capability bounding set for the unit, and set
        <var>DevicePolicy=closed</var> (see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control(5)
    </a>
        for details). Note that using this setting will disconnect propagation of mounts from the service to
        the host (propagation in the opposite direction continues to work). This means that this setting may
        not be used for services which shall be able to install mount points in the main mount namespace. The
        new /dev/ will be mounted read-only and 'noexec'. The latter may break old
        programs which try to set up executable memory by using
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)
    </a> of
        /dev/zero instead of using MAP_ANON. For this setting the
        same restrictions regarding mount propagation and privileges apply as for
        <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var> and related calls, see above. If turned on and if running in user
        mode, or in system mode, but without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting
        <var>User=</var>), <var>NoNewPrivileges=yes</var> is implied.</p>
<p>Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if mount
        namespaces are not available), and the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely on
        this setting for security.</p>
<p>When access to some but not all devices must be possible, the <var>DeviceAllow=</var>
        setting might be used instead. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control(5)
    </a>.
