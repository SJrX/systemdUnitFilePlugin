<p>Takes an errno error number (between 1 and 4095) or errno name
        such as EPERM, EACCES or EUCLEAN, to
        return when the system call filter configured with <var>SystemCallFilter=</var> is triggered,
        instead of terminating the process immediately. See <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html">errno(3)
    </a> for a
        full list of error codes. When this setting is not used, or when the empty string or the special
        setting kill is assigned, the process will be terminated immediately when the
        filter is triggered.</p>
