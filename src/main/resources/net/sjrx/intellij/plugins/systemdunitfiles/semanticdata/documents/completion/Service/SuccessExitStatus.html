<p>Takes a list of exit status definitions that, when returned by the main service
        process, will be considered successful termination, in addition to the normal successful exit status
        0 and, except for <var>Type=oneshot</var>, the signals SIGHUP, SIGINT,
        SIGTERM, and SIGPIPE. Exit status definitions can be
        numeric termination statuses, termination status names, or termination signal names, separated by
        spaces. See the Process Exit Codes section in
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)
    </a> for
        a list of termination status names (for this setting only the part without the
        EXIT_ or EX_ prefix should be used). See <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html">signal(7)
    </a> for
        a list of signal names.</p>
<p>Note that this setting does not change the mapping between numeric exit statuses and their
        names, i.e. regardless how this setting is used 0 will still be mapped to SUCCESS
        (and thus typically shown as 0/SUCCESS in tool outputs) and 1 to
        FAILURE (and thus typically shown as 1/FAILURE), and so on. It
        only controls what happens as effect of these exit statuses, and how it propagates to the state of
        the service as a whole.</p>
<p>This option may appear more than once, in which case the list of successful exit statuses is
        merged. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list is reset, all prior assignments of
        this option will have no effect.</p>
<p>Note: systemd-analyze exit-status may be used to list exit statuses and
        translate between numerical status values and names.</p>
