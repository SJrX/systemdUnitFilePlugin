<p>Configures arbitrary textual or binary data to pass via file descriptor 0 (STDIN) to
        the executed processes. These settings have no effect unless <var>StandardInput=</var> is set
        to <var>data</var> (which is the default if <var>StandardInput=</var> is not set
        otherwise, but <var>StandardInputText=</var>/<var>StandardInputData=</var> is). Use
        this option to embed process input data directly in the unit file.</p>
<p><var>StandardInputText=</var> accepts arbitrary textual data. C-style escapes for special
        characters as well as the usual %-specifiers are resolved. Each time this setting is used
        the specified text is appended to the per-unit data buffer, followed by a newline character (thus every use
        appends a new line to the end of the buffer). Note that leading and trailing whitespace of lines configured
        with this option is removed. If an empty line is specified the buffer is cleared (hence, in order to insert an
        empty line, add an additional \n to the end or beginning of a line).</p>
<p><var>StandardInputData=</var> accepts arbitrary binary data, encoded in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.8">Base64</a>. No escape sequences or specifiers are
        resolved. Any whitespace in the encoded version is ignored during decoding.</p>
<p>Note that <var>StandardInputText=</var> and <var>StandardInputData=</var> operate on the
        same data buffer, and may be mixed in order to configure both binary and textual data for the same input
        stream. The textual or binary data is joined strictly in the order the settings appear in the unit
        file. Assigning an empty string to either will reset the data buffer.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that in order to maintain readability long unit file settings may be split into
        multiple lines, by suffixing each line (except for the last) with a \ character (see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)
    </a> for
        details). This is particularly useful for large data configured with these two options. Example:</p>
