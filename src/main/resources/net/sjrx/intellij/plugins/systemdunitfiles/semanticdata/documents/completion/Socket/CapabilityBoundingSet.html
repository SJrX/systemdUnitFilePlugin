<p>Controls which capabilities to include in the capability bounding set for the
        executed process. See <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)
    </a>
        for details. Takes a whitespace-separated list of capability names,
        e.g. CAP_SYS_ADMIN, CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,
        CAP_SYS_PTRACE. Capabilities listed will be included in the bounding set, all
        others are removed. If the list of capabilities is prefixed with ~, all but the
        listed capabilities will be included, the effect of the assignment inverted. Note that this option
        also affects the respective capabilities in the effective, permitted and inheritable capability
        sets. If this option is not used, the capability bounding set is not modified on process execution,
        hence no limits on the capabilities of the process are enforced. This option may appear more than
        once, in which case the bounding sets are merged by OR, or by
        AND if the lines are prefixed with ~ (see below). If the
        empty string is assigned to this option, the bounding set is reset to the empty capability set, and
        all prior settings have no effect. If set to ~ (without any further argument),
        the bounding set is reset to the full set of available capabilities, also undoing any previous
        settings. This does not affect commands prefixed with +.</p>
<p>Use
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-analyze.1.html">systemd-analyze(1)
    </a>'s
        capability command to retrieve a list of capabilities defined on the local
        system.</p>
<p>Example: if a unit has the following,
        CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_A CAP_B
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_B CAP_C
        then CAP_A, CAP_B, and
        CAP_C are set. If the second line is prefixed with
        ~, e.g.,
        CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_A CAP_B
CapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_B CAP_C
        then, only CAP_A is set.</p>
