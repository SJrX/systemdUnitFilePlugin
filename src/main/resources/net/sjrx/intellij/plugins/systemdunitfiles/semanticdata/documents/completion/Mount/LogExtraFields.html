<p>Configures additional log metadata fields to include in all log records generated by
        processes associated with this unit. This setting takes one or more journal field assignments in the
        format FIELD=VALUE separated by whitespace. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.journal-fields.7.html">systemd.journal-fields(7)
    </a>
        for details on the journal field concept. Even though the underlying journal implementation permits
        binary field values, this setting accepts only valid UTF-8 values. To include space characters in a
        journal field value, enclose the assignment in double quotes ("). 
        The usual specifiers are expanded in all assignments (see below). Note that this setting is not only
        useful for attaching additional metadata to log records of a unit, but given that all fields and
        values are indexed may also be used to implement cross-unit log record matching. Assign an empty
        string to reset the list.</p>
