<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true and <var>StandardOutput=</var> or
        <var>StandardError=</var> are set to <var>journal</var> or <var>kmsg</var> (or to
        the same settings in combination with <var>+console</var>), log lines written by the executed
        process that are prefixed with a log level will be processed with this log level set but the prefix
        removed. If set to false, the interpretation of these prefixes is disabled and the logged lines are
        passed on as-is. This only applies to log messages written to stdout or stderr. For details about
        this prefixing see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd-daemon.3.html">sd-daemon(3)
    </a>.
        Defaults to true.</p>
