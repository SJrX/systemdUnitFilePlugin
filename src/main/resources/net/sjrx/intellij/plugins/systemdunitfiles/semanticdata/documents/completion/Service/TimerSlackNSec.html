<p>Sets the timer slack in nanoseconds for the executed processes. The timer slack controls the
        accuracy of wake-ups triggered by timers. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)
    </a> for more
        information. Note that in contrast to most other time span definitions this parameter takes an integer value in
        nano-seconds if no unit is specified. The usual time units are understood too.</p>
