<p>Configures a limit on how often this path unit may be activated within a specific
        time interval. The <var>TriggerLimitIntervalSec=</var> may be used to configure the length of
        the time interval in the usual time units us, ms,
        s, min, h, â€¦ and defaults to 2s. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)
    </a> for
        details on the various time units understood. The <var>TriggerLimitBurst=</var> setting takes
        a positive integer value and specifies the number of permitted activations per time interval, and
        defaults to 200. Set either to 0 to disable any form of trigger rate limiting. If the limit is hit,
        the unit is placed into a failure mode, and will not watch the paths anymore until restarted. Note
        that this limit is enforced before the service activation is enqueued.</p>
