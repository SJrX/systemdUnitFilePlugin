<p>Sets the default nice level (scheduling priority) for executed processes. Takes an
        integer between -20 (highest priority) and 19 (lowest priority). In case of resource contention,
        smaller values mean more resources will be made available to the unit's processes, larger values mean
        less resources will be made available. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setpriority.2.html">setpriority(2)
    </a> for
        details.</p>
