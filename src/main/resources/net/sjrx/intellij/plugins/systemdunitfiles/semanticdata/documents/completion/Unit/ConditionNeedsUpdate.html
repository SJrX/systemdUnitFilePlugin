<p>Takes one of /var/ or /etc/ as argument,
          possibly prefixed with a ! (to invert the condition). This condition may be
          used to conditionalize units on whether the specified directory requires an update because
          /usr/'s modification time is newer than the stamp file
          .updated in the specified directory. This is useful to implement offline
          updates of the vendor operating system resources in /usr/ that require updating
          of /etc/ or /var/ on the next following boot. Units making
          use of this condition should order themselves before
          <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-update-done.service.8.html">systemd-update-done.service(8)
    </a>,
          to make sure they run before the stamp file's modification time gets reset indicating a completed
          update.</p>
<p>If the <var>systemd.condition-needs-update=</var> option is specified on the kernel
          command line (taking a boolean), it will override the result of this condition check, taking
          precedence over any file modification time checks. If the kernel command line option is used,
          systemd-update-done.service will not have immediate effect on any following
          <var>ConditionNeedsUpdate=</var> checks, until the system is rebooted where the kernel
          command line option is not specified anymore.</p>
<p>Note that to make this scheme effective, the timestamp of /usr/ should
          be explicitly updated after its contents are modified. The kernel will automatically update
          modification timestamp on a directory only when immediate children of a directory are modified; an
          modification of nested files will not automatically result in mtime of /usr/
          being updated.</p>
<p>Also note that if the update method includes a call to execute appropriate post-update steps
          itself, it should not touch the timestamp of /usr/. In a typical distribution
          packaging scheme, packages will do any required update steps as part of the installation or
          upgrade, to make package contents immediately usable. <var>ConditionNeedsUpdate=</var>
          should be used with other update mechanisms where such an immediate update does not
          happen.</p>
