<p>Takes an absolute path of a device node, file or other resource to mount. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html">mount(8)
    </a> for
        details. If this refers to a device node, a dependency on the respective device unit is automatically
        created. (See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.device.5.html">systemd.device(5)
    </a>
        for more information.) This option is mandatory. Note that the usual specifier expansion is applied
        to this setting, literal percent characters should hence be written as %%. If this mount is a bind mount and the specified path does not exist
        yet it is created as directory.</p>
