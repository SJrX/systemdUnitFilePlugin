<p>Sets the CPU scheduling priority for executed processes. The available priority range
        depends on the selected CPU scheduling policy (see above). For real-time scheduling policies an
        integer between 1 (lowest priority) and 99 (highest priority) can be used. In case of CPU resource
        contention, smaller values mean less CPU time is made available to the service, larger values mean
        more. See <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler(2)
