<p>Run the unit's processes in the specified journal namespace. Expects a short
        user-defined string identifying the namespace. If not used the processes of the service are run in
        the default journal namespace, i.e. their log stream is collected and processed by
        systemd-journald.service. If this option is used any log data generated by
        processes of this unit (regardless if via the syslog(), journal native logging
        or stdout/stderr logging) is collected and processed by an instance of the
        systemd-journald@.service template unit, which manages the specified
        namespace. The log data is stored in a data store independent from the default log namespace's data
        store. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-journald.service.8.html">systemd-journald.service(8)
    </a>
        for details about journal namespaces.</p>
<p>Internally, journal namespaces are implemented through Linux mount namespacing and
        over-mounting the directory that contains the relevant AF_UNIX sockets used for
        logging in the unit's mount namespace. Since mount namespaces are used this setting disconnects
        propagation of mounts from the unit's processes to the host, similarly to how
        <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var> and similar settings describe above work. Journal namespaces may hence
        not be used for services that need to establish mount points on the host.</p>
<p>When this option is used the unit will automatically gain ordering and requirement dependencies
        on the two socket units associated with the systemd-journald@.service instance
        so that they are automatically established prior to the unit starting up. Note that when this option
        is used log output of this service does not appear in the regular
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)
    </a>
        output, unless the <var>--namespace=</var> option is used.</p>
