<p><var>ConditionKernelCommandLine=</var> may be used to check whether a
          specific kernel command line option is set (or if prefixed with the exclamation mark â€” unset). The
          argument must either be a single word, or an assignment (i.e. two words, separated by
          =). In the former case the kernel command line is searched for the word
          appearing as is, or as left hand side of an assignment. In the latter case, the exact assignment is
          looked for with right and left hand side matching. This operates on the kernel command line
          communicated to userspace via /proc/cmdline, except when the service manager
          is invoked as payload of a container manager, in which case the command line of PID
          1 is used instead (i.e. /proc/1/cmdline).</p>
