<p>Takes a boolean argument. If set, locks down the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/personality.2.html">personality(2)
    </a> system
        call so that the kernel execution domain may not be changed from the default or the personality selected with
        <var>Personality=</var> directive. This may be useful to improve security, because odd personality
        emulations may be poorly tested and source of vulnerabilities. If running in user mode, or in system mode, but
        without the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting <var>User=</var>),
        <var>NoNewPrivileges=yes</var> is implied.</p>
