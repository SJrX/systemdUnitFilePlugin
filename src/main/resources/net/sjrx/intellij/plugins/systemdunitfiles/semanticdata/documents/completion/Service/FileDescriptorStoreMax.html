<p>Configure how many file descriptors may be stored in the service manager for the
        service using
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd_pid_notify_with_fds.3.html">sd_pid_notify_with_fds(3)
    </a>'s
        FDSTORE=1 messages. This is useful for implementing services that can restart
        after an explicit request or a crash without losing state. Any open sockets and other file
        descriptors which should not be closed during the restart may be stored this way. Application state
        can either be serialized to a file in /run/, or better, stored in a
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html">memfd_create(2)
    </a>
        memory file descriptor. Defaults to 0, i.e. no file descriptors may be stored in the service
        manager. All file descriptors passed to the service manager from a specific service are passed back
        to the service's main process on the next service restart (see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd_listen_fds.3.html">sd_listen_fds(3)
    </a> for
        details about the precise protocol used and the order in which the file descriptors are passed). Any
        file descriptors passed to the service manager are automatically closed when
        POLLHUP or POLLERR is seen on them, or when the service is
        fully stopped and no job is queued or being executed for it. If this option is used,
        <var>NotifyAccess=</var> (see above) should be set to open access to the notification socket
        provided by systemd. If <var>NotifyAccess=</var> is not set, it will be implicitly set to
        <var>main</var>.</p>
