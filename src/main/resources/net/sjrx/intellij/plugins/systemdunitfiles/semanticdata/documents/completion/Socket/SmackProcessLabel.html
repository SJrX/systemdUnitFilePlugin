<p>Takes a <var>SMACK64</var> security label as argument. The process executed by the unit
        will be started under this label and SMACK will decide whether the process is allowed to run or not, based on
        it. The process will continue to run under the label specified here unless the executable has its own
        <var>SMACK64EXEC</var> label, in which case the process will transition to run under that label. When not
        specified, the label that systemd is running under is used. This directive is ignored if SMACK is
        disabled.</p>
<p>The value may be prefixed by -, in which case all errors will be ignored. An empty
        value may be specified to unset previous assignments. This does not affect commands prefixed with
        +.</p>
