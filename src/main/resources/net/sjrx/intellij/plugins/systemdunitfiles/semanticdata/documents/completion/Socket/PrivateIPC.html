<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, sets up a new IPC namespace for the executed processes.
        Each IPC namespace has its own set of System V IPC identifiers and its own POSIX message queue file system.
        This is useful to avoid name clash of IPC identifiers. Defaults to false. It is possible to run two or
        more units within the same private IPC namespace by using the <var>JoinsNamespaceOf=</var> directive,
        see <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)
    </a> for
        details.</p>
<p>Note that IPC namespacing does not have an effect on
        AF_UNIX sockets, which are the most common
        form of IPC used on Linux. Instead, AF_UNIX
        sockets in the file system are subject to mount namespacing, and
        those in the abstract namespace are subject to network namespacing.
        IPC namespacing only has an effect on SysV IPC (which is mostly
        legacy) as well as POSIX message queues (for which
        AF_UNIX/SOCK_SEQPACKET
        sockets are typically a better replacement). IPC namespacing also
        has no effect on POSIX shared memory (which is subject to mount
        namespacing) either. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ipc_namespaces.7.html">ipc_namespaces(7)
    </a> for
        the details.</p>
<p>Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if IPC namespaces are
        not available), and the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely on this setting for
        security.</p>
