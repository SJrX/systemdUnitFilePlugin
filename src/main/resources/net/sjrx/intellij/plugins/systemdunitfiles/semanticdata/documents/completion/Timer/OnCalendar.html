<p>Defines realtime (i.e. wallclock) timers with
        calendar event expressions. See
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)
    </a>
        for more information on the syntax of calendar event
        expressions. Otherwise, the semantics are similar to
        <var>OnActiveSec=</var> and related settings.</p>
<p>Note that timers do not necessarily expire at the
        precise time configured with this setting, as it is subject to
        the <var>AccuracySec=</var> setting
        below.</p>
<p>May be specified more than once, in which case the timer unit will trigger whenever any of the
        specified expressions elapse. Moreover calendar timers and monotonic timers (see above) may be
        combined within the same timer unit.</p>
<p>If the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the list of timers is reset (both
        <var>OnCalendar=</var> timers and monotonic timers, see above), and all prior assignments
        will have no effect.</p>
