<p><var>ConditionCredential=</var> may be used to check whether a credential
          by the specified name was passed into the service manager. See <a href="https://systemd.io/CREDENTIALS">System and Service Credentials</a> for details about
          credentials. If used in services for the system service manager this may be used to conditionalize
          services based on system credentials passed in. If used in services for the per-user service
          manager this may be used to conditionalize services based on credentials passed into the
          unit@.service service instance belonging to the user. The argument must be a
          valid credential name.</p>
