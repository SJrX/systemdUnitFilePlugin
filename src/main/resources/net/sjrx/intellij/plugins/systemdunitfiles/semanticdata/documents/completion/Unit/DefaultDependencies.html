<p>Takes a boolean argument. If
        <var>yes</var>, (the default), a few default
        dependencies will implicitly be created for the unit. The
        actual dependencies created depend on the unit type. For
        example, for service units, these dependencies ensure that the
        service is started only after basic system initialization is
        completed and is properly terminated on system shutdown. See
        the respective man pages for details. Generally, only services
        involved with early boot or late shutdown should set this
        option to <var>no</var>. It is highly recommended to
        leave this option enabled for the majority of common units. If
        set to <var>no</var>, this option does not disable
        all implicit dependencies, just non-essential
        ones.</p>
