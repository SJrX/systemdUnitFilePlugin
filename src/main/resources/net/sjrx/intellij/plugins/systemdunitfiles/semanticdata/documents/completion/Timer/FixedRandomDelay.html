<p>Takes a boolean argument. When enabled, the randomized offset specified by
        <var>RandomizedDelaySec=</var> is reused for all firings of the same timer. For a given timer
        unit, the offset depends on the machine ID, user identifier and timer name, which means that it is
        stable between restarts of the manager. This effectively creates a fixed offset for an individual
        timer, reducing the jitter in firings of this timer, while still avoiding firing at the same time as
        other similarly configured timers.</p>
<p>This setting has no effect if <var>RandomizedDelaySec=</var> is set to 0. Defaults to
        <var>false</var>.</p>
