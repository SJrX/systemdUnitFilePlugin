<p>Defines monotonic timers relative to different
        starting points:</p>
<p>Multiple directives may be combined of the same and of different types, in which case the timer
        unit will trigger whenever any of the specified timer expressions elapse. For example, by combining
        <var>OnBootSec=</var> and <var>OnUnitActiveSec=</var>, it is possible to define a
        timer that elapses in regular intervals and activates a specific service each time. Moreover, both
        monotonic time expressions and <var>OnCalendar=</var> calendar expressions may be combined in
        the same timer unit.</p>
<p>The arguments to the directives are time spans
        configured in seconds. Example: "OnBootSec=50" means 50s after
        boot-up. The argument may also include time units. Example:
        "OnBootSec=5h 30min" means 5 hours and 30 minutes after
        boot-up. For details about the syntax of time spans, see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)
    </a>.</p>
<p>If a timer configured with <var>OnBootSec=</var>
        or <var>OnStartupSec=</var> is already in the past
        when the timer unit is activated, it will immediately elapse
        and the configured unit is started. This is not the case for
        timers defined in the other directives.</p>
<p>These are monotonic timers, independent of wall-clock time and timezones. If the computer is
        temporarily suspended, the monotonic clock generally pauses, too. Note that if
        <var>WakeSystem=</var> is used, a different monotonic clock is selected that continues to
        advance while the system is suspended and thus can be used as the trigger to resume the
        system.</p>
<p>If the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the list of timers is reset (both
        monotonic timers and <var>OnCalendar=</var> timers, see below), and all prior assignments
        will have no effect.</p>
<p>Note that timers do not necessarily expire at the
        precise time configured with these settings, as they are
        subject to the <var>AccuracySec=</var> setting
        below.</p>
