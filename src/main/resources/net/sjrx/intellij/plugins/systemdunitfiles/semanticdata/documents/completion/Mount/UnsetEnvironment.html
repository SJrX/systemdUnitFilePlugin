<p>Explicitly unset environment variable assignments that would normally be passed from the
        service manager to invoked processes of this unit. Takes a space-separated list of variable names or variable
        assignments. This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed variables/assignments will
        be unset. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list of environment variables/assignments to
        unset is reset. If a variable assignment is specified (that is: a variable name, followed by
        =, followed by its value), then any environment variable matching this precise assignment is
        removed. If a variable name is specified (that is a variable name without any following = or
        value), then any assignment matching the variable name, regardless of its value is removed. Note that the
        effect of <var>UnsetEnvironment=</var> is applied as final step when the environment list passed to
        executed processes is compiled. That means it may undo assignments from any configuration source, including
        assignments made through <var>Environment=</var> or <var>EnvironmentFile=</var>, inherited from
        the system manager's global set of environment variables, inherited via <var>PassEnvironment=</var>,
        set by the service manager itself (such as <var>$NOTIFY_SOCKET</var> and such), or set by a PAM module
        (in case <var>PAMName=</var> is used).</p>
<p>See "Environment Variables in Spawned Processes" below for a description of how those
        settings combine to form the inherited environment. See <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)
    </a> for general
        information about environment variables.</p>
