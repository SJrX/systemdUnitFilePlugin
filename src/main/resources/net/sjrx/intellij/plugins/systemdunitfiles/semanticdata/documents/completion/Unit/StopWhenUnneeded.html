<p>Takes a boolean argument. If
        <var>true</var>, this unit will be stopped when it is no
        longer used. Note that, in order to minimize the work to be
        executed, systemd will not stop units by default unless they
        are conflicting with other units, or the user explicitly
        requested their shut down. If this option is set, a unit will
        be automatically cleaned up if no other active unit requires
        it. Defaults to <var>false</var>.</p>
