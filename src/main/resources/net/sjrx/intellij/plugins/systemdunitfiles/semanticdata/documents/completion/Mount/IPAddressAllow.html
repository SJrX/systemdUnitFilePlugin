<p>Turn on network traffic filtering for IP packets sent and received over
          AF_INET and AF_INET6 sockets. Both directives take a
          space separated list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, each optionally suffixed with an address prefix
          length in bits after a / character. If the suffix is omitted, the address is
          considered a host address, i.e. the filter covers the whole address (32 bits for IPv4, 128 bits for
          IPv6).</p>
<p>The access lists configured with this option are applied to all sockets created by processes
          of this unit (or in the case of socket units, associated with it). The lists are implicitly
          combined with any lists configured for any of the parent slice units this unit might be a member
          of. By default both access lists are empty. Both ingress and egress traffic is filtered by these
          settings. In case of ingress traffic the source IP address is checked against these access lists,
          in case of egress traffic the destination IP address is checked. The following rules are applied in
          turn:</p>
<p>In order to implement an allow-listing IP firewall, it is recommended to use a
          <var>IPAddressDeny=</var>any setting on an upper-level slice unit
          (such as the root slice -.slice or the slice containing all system services
          system.slice â€“ see
          <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/systemd.special.7.html">systemd.special(7)
    </a>
          for details on these slice units), plus individual per-service <var>IPAddressAllow=</var>
          lines permitting network access to relevant services, and only them.</p>
<p>Note that for socket-activated services, the IP access list configured on the socket unit
          applies to all sockets associated with it directly, but not to any sockets created by the
          ultimately activated services for it. Conversely, the IP access list configured for the service is
          not applied to any sockets passed into the service via socket activation. Thus, it is usually a
          good idea to replicate the IP access lists on both the socket and the service unit. Nevertheless,
          it may make sense to maintain one list more open and the other one more restricted, depending on
          the usecase.</p>
<p>If these settings are used multiple times in the same unit the specified lists are combined. If an
          empty string is assigned to these settings the specific access list is reset and all previous settings undone.</p>
<p>In place of explicit IPv4 or IPv6 address and prefix length specifications a small set of symbolic
          names may be used. The following names are defined:</p>
<p>Note that these settings might not be supported on some systems (for example if eBPF control group
          support is not enabled in the underlying kernel or container manager). These settings will have no effect in
          that case. If compatibility with such systems is desired it is hence recommended to not exclusively rely on
          them for IP security.</p>
