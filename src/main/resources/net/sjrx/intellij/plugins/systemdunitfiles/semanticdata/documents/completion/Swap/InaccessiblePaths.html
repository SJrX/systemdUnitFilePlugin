<p>Sets up a new file system namespace for executed processes. These options may be used
        to limit access a process has to the file system. Each setting takes a space-separated list of paths
        relative to the host's root directory (i.e. the system running the service manager). Note that if
        paths contain symlinks, they are resolved relative to the root directory set with
        <var>RootDirectory=</var>/<var>RootImage=</var>.</p>
<p>Paths listed in <var>ReadWritePaths=</var> are accessible from within the namespace
        with the same access modes as from outside of it. Paths listed in <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var>
        are accessible for reading only, writing will be refused even if the usual file access controls would
        permit this. Nest <var>ReadWritePaths=</var> inside of <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var> in
        order to provide writable subdirectories within read-only directories. Use
        <var>ReadWritePaths=</var> in order to allow-list specific paths for write access if
        <var>ProtectSystem=strict</var> is used.</p>
<p>Paths listed in <var>InaccessiblePaths=</var> will be made inaccessible for processes inside
        the namespace along with everything below them in the file system hierarchy. This may be more restrictive than
        desired, because it is not possible to nest <var>ReadWritePaths=</var>, <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var>,
        <var>BindPaths=</var>, or <var>BindReadOnlyPaths=</var> inside it. For a more flexible option,
        see <var>TemporaryFileSystem=</var>.</p>
<p>Content in paths listed in <var>NoExecPaths=</var> are not executable even if the usual
        file access controls would permit this. Nest <var>ExecPaths=</var> inside of
        <var>NoExecPaths=</var> in order to provide executable content within non-executable
        directories.</p>
<p>Non-directory paths may be specified as well. These options may be specified more than once,
        in which case all paths listed will have limited access from within the namespace. If the empty string is
        assigned to this option, the specific list is reset, and all prior assignments have no effect.</p>
<p>Paths in <var>ReadWritePaths=</var>, <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var>,
        <var>InaccessiblePaths=</var>, <var>ExecPaths=</var> and
        <var>NoExecPaths=</var> may be prefixed with -, in which case they will be
        ignored when they do not exist. If prefixed with + the paths are taken relative to the root
        directory of the unit, as configured with <var>RootDirectory=</var>/<var>RootImage=</var>,
        instead of relative to the root directory of the host (see above). When combining - and
        + on the same path make sure to specify - first, and +
        second.</p>
<p>Note that these settings will disconnect propagation of mounts from the unit's processes to the
        host. This means that this setting may not be used for services which shall be able to install mount points in
        the main mount namespace. For <var>ReadWritePaths=</var> and <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var>,
        propagation in the other direction is not affected, i.e. mounts created on the host generally appear in the
        unit processes' namespace, and mounts removed on the host also disappear there too. In particular, note that
        mount propagation from host to unit will result in unmodified mounts to be created in the unit's namespace,
        i.e. writable mounts appearing on the host will be writable in the unit's namespace too, even when propagated
        below a path marked with <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var>! Restricting access with these options hence does
        not extend to submounts of a directory that are created later on. This means the lock-down offered by that
        setting is not complete, and does not offer full protection. </p>
<p>Note that the effect of these settings may be undone by privileged processes. In order to set up an
        effective sandboxed environment for a unit it is thus recommended to combine these settings with either
        <var>CapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_SYS_ADMIN</var> or
        <var>SystemCallFilter=~@mount</var>.</p>
<p>Simple allow-list example using these directives:
        [Service]
ReadOnlyPaths=/
ReadWritePaths=/var /run
InaccessiblePaths=-/lost+found
NoExecPaths=/
ExecPaths=/usr/sbin/my_daemon /usr/lib /usr/lib64
</p>
