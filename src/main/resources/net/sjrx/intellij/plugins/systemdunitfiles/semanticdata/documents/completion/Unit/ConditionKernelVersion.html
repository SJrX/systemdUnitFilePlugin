<p><var>ConditionKernelVersion=</var> may be used to check whether the kernel
          version (as reported by uname -r) matches a certain expression, or if prefixed
          with the exclamation mark, does not match. The argument must be a list of (potentially quoted)
          expressions. Each expression starts with one of = or != for
          string comparisons, &lt;, &lt;=, ==,
          &lt;&gt;, &gt;=, &gt; for version
          comparisons, or $=, !$= for a shell-style glob match. If no
          operator is specified, $= is implied.</p>
<p>Note that using the kernel version string is an unreliable way to determine which features
          are supported by a kernel, because of the widespread practice of backporting drivers, features, and
          fixes from newer upstream kernels into older versions provided by distributions. Hence, this check
          is inherently unportable and should not be used for units which may be used on different
          distributions.</p>
