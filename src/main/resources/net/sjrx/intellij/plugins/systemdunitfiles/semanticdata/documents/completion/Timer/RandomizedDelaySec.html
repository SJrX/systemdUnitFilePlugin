<p>Delay the timer by a randomly selected, evenly distributed amount of time between 0
        and the specified time value. Defaults to 0, indicating that no randomized delay shall be applied.
        Each timer unit will determine this delay randomly before each iteration, and the delay will simply
        be added on top of the next determined elapsing time, unless modified with
        <var>FixedRandomDelay=</var>, see below.</p>
<p>This setting is useful to stretch dispatching of similarly configured timer events over a
        certain time interval, to prevent them from firing all at the same time, possibly resulting in
        resource congestion.</p>
<p>Note the relation to <var>AccuracySec=</var> above: the latter allows the service
        manager to coalesce timer events within a specified time range in order to minimize wakeups, while
        this setting does the opposite: it stretches timer events over an interval, to make it unlikely that
        they fire simultaneously. If <var>RandomizedDelaySec=</var> and
        <var>AccuracySec=</var> are used in conjunction, first the randomized delay is added, and
        then the result is possibly further shifted to coalesce it with other timer events happening on the
        system. As mentioned above <var>AccuracySec=</var> defaults to 1 minute and
        <var>RandomizedDelaySec=</var> to 0, thus encouraging coalescing of timer events. In order to
        optimally stretch timer events over a certain range of time, set
        <var>AccuracySec=1us</var> and <var>RandomizedDelaySec=</var> to some higher value.
