<p>Additional commands that are executed after the service is stopped. This includes cases where
        the commands configured in <var>ExecStop=</var> were used, where the service does not have any
        <var>ExecStop=</var> defined, or where the service exited unexpectedly. This argument takes multiple
        command lines, following the same scheme as described for <var>ExecStart=</var>. Use of these settings
        is optional. Specifier and environment variable substitution is supported. Note that – unlike
        <var>ExecStop=</var> – commands specified with this setting are invoked when a service failed to start
        up correctly and is shut down again.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use this setting for clean-up operations that shall be executed even when the
        service failed to start up correctly. Commands configured with this setting need to be able to operate even if
        the service failed starting up half-way and left incompletely initialized data around. As the service's
        processes have been terminated already when the commands specified with this setting are executed they should
        not attempt to communicate with them.</p>
<p>Note that all commands that are configured with this setting are invoked with the result code of the
        service, as well as the main process' exit code and status, set in the <var>$SERVICE_RESULT</var>,
        <var>$EXIT_CODE</var> and <var>$EXIT_STATUS</var> environment variables, see
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)
    </a> for
        details.</p>
<p>Note that the execution of <var>ExecStopPost=</var> is taken into account for the purpose of
        <var>Before=</var>/<var>After=</var> ordering constraints.</p>
