<p>Specifies how processes of this unit shall be killed. One of
        <var>control-group</var>, <var>mixed</var>, <var>process</var>,
        <var>none</var>.</p>
<p>If set to <var>control-group</var>, all remaining processes in the control group of this
        unit will be killed on unit stop (for services: after the stop command is executed, as configured
        with <var>ExecStop=</var>). If set to <var>mixed</var>, the
        SIGTERM signal (see below) is sent to the main process while the subsequent
        SIGKILL signal (see below) is sent to all remaining processes of the unit's
        control group. If set to <var>process</var>, only the main process itself is killed (not
        recommended!). If set to <var>none</var>, no process is killed (strongly recommended
        against!). In this case, only the stop command will be executed on unit stop, but no process will be
        killed otherwise.  Processes remaining alive after stop are left in their control group and the
        control group continues to exist after stop unless empty.</p>
<p>Note that it is not recommended to set <var>KillMode=</var> to
        process or even none, as this allows processes to escape
        the service manager's lifecycle and resource management, and to remain running even while their
        service is considered stopped and is assumed to not consume any resources.</p>
<p>Processes will first be terminated via SIGTERM (unless the signal to send
        is changed via <var>KillSignal=</var> or <var>RestartKillSignal=</var>). Optionally,
        this is immediately followed by a SIGHUP (if enabled with
        <var>SendSIGHUP=</var>). If processes still remain after:
        
          the main process of a unit has exited (applies to <var>KillMode=</var>:
              <var>mixed</var>)
          the delay configured via the <var>TimeoutStopSec=</var> has passed
              (applies to <var>KillMode=</var>: <var>control-group</var>, <var>mixed</var>,
              <var>process</var>)
        

        the termination request is repeated with the SIGKILL signal or the signal specified via
        <var>FinalKillSignal=</var> (unless this is disabled via the <var>SendSIGKILL=</var>
        option). See <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kill.2.html">kill(2)
    </a>
        for more information.</p>
<p>Defaults to <var>control-group</var>.</p>
