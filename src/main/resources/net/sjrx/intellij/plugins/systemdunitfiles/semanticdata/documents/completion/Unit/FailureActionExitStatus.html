<p>Controls the exit status to propagate back to an invoking container manager (in case of a
        system service) or service manager (in case of a user manager) when the
        <var>FailureAction=</var>/<var>SuccessAction=</var> are set to <var>exit</var> or
        <var>exit-force</var> and the action is triggered. By default the exit status of the main process of the
        triggering unit (if this applies) is propagated. Takes a value in the range 0â€¦255 or the empty string to
        request default behaviour.</p>
