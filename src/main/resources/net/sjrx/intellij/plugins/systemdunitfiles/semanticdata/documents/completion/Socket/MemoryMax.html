<p>Specify the absolute limit on memory usage of the executed processes in this unit. If memory usage
          cannot be contained under the limit, out-of-memory killer is invoked inside the unit. It is recommended to
          use <var>MemoryHigh=</var> as the main control mechanism and use <var>MemoryMax=</var> as the
          last line of defense.</p>
<p>Takes a memory size in bytes. If the value is suffixed with K, M, G or T, the specified memory size is
          parsed as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes (with the base 1024), respectively. Alternatively, a
          percentage value may be specified, which is taken relative to the installed physical memory on the system. If
          assigned the special value infinity, no memory limit is applied. This controls the
          memory.max control group attribute. For details about this control group attribute, see
          <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#memory-interface-files">Memory Interface Files</a>.</p>
