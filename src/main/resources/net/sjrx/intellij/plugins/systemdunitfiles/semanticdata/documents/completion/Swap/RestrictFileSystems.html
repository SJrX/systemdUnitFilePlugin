<p>Restricts the set of filesystems processes of this unit can open files on. Takes a space-separated
        list of filesystem names. Any filesystem listed is made accessible to the unit's processes, access to filesystem
        types not listed is prohibited (allow-listing). If the first character of the list is ~, the
        effect is inverted: access to the filesystems listed is prohibited (deny-listing). If the empty string is assigned,
        access to filesystems is not restricted.</p>
<p>If you specify both types of this option (i.e. allow-listing and deny-listing), the first encountered will take
        precedence and will dictate the default action (allow access to the filesystem or deny it). Then the next occurrences
        of this option will add or delete the listed filesystems from the set of the restricted filesystems, depending on its
        type and the default action.</p>
<p>Example: if a unit has the following,
        RestrictFileSystems=ext4 tmpfs
RestrictFileSystems=ext2 ext4
        then access to ext4, tmpfs, and ext2 is allowed
        and access to other filesystems is denied.</p>
<p>Example: if a unit has the following,
        RestrictFileSystems=ext4 tmpfs
RestrictFileSystems=~ext4
        then only access tmpfs is allowed.</p>
<p>Example: if a unit has the following,
        RestrictFileSystems=~ext4 tmpfs
RestrictFileSystems=ext4
        then only access to tmpfs is denied.</p>
<p>As the number of possible filesystems is large, predefined sets of filesystems are provided. A set
        starts with @ character, followed by name of the set.</p>
<p>Use
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemd-analyze.1.html">systemd-analyze(1)
    </a>'s
        filesystems command to retrieve a list of filesystems defined on the local
        system.</p>
<p>Note that this setting might not be supported on some systems (for example if the LSM eBPF hook is
        not enabled in the underlying kernel or if not using the unified control group hierarchy). In that case this setting
        has no effect.</p>
