<p>Takes a space-separated list of system call names. If this setting is used, all
        system calls executed by the unit processes for the listed ones will be logged. If the first
        character of the list is ~, the effect is inverted: all system calls except the
        listed system calls will be logged. If running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the
        CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (e.g. setting <var>User=</var>),
        <var>NoNewPrivileges=yes</var> is implied. This feature makes use of the Secure Computing
        Mode 2 interfaces of the kernel ('seccomp filtering') and is useful for auditing or setting up a
        minimal sandboxing environment. This option may be specified more than once, in which case the filter
        masks are merged. If the empty string is assigned, the filter is reset, all prior assignments will
        have no effect. This does not affect commands prefixed with +.</p>
