<p><var>ConditionUser=</var> takes a numeric UID, a UNIX
          user name, or the special value @system. This condition may be used to check
          whether the service manager is running as the given user. The special value
          @system can be used to check if the user id is within the system user
          range. This option is not useful for system services, as the system manager exclusively runs as the
          root user, and thus the test result is constant.</p>
