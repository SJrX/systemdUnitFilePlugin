<p>Takes a boolean parameter. If set, all System V and POSIX IPC objects owned by the user and
        group the processes of this unit are run as are removed when the unit is stopped. This setting only has an
        effect if at least one of <var>User=</var>, <var>Group=</var> and
        <var>DynamicUser=</var> are used. It has no effect on IPC objects owned by the root user. Specifically,
        this removes System V semaphores, as well as System V and POSIX shared memory segments and message queues. If
        multiple units use the same user or group the IPC objects are removed when the last of these units is
        stopped. This setting is implied if <var>DynamicUser=</var> is set.</p>
