<p>Takes a boolean argument. If true, sets up a new file system namespace for the
        executed processes and mounts private /tmp/ and /var/tmp/
        directories inside it that are not shared by processes outside of the namespace. This is useful to
        secure access to temporary files of the process, but makes sharing between processes via
        /tmp/ or /var/tmp/ impossible. If true, all temporary files
        created by a service in these directories will be removed after the service is stopped. Defaults to
        false. It is possible to run two or more units within the same private /tmp/ and
        /var/tmp/ namespace by using the <var>JoinsNamespaceOf=</var> directive,
        see <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)
    </a>
        for details. This setting is implied if <var>DynamicUser=</var> is set. For this setting, the
        same restrictions regarding mount propagation and privileges apply as for
        <var>ReadOnlyPaths=</var> and related calls, see above. Enabling this setting has the side
        effect of adding <var>Requires=</var> and <var>After=</var> dependencies on all mount
        units necessary to access /tmp/ and /var/tmp/. Moreover an
        implicitly <var>After=</var> ordering on
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service.8.html">systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service(8)
    </a>
        is added.</p>
<p>Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if mount namespaces are not
        available), and the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely on this setting for
        security.</p>
