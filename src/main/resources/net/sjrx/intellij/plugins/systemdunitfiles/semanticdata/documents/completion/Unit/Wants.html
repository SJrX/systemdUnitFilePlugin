<p>Configures (weak) requirement dependencies on other units. This option may be
        specified more than once or multiple space-separated units may be specified in one option in which
        case dependencies for all listed names will be created. Dependencies of this type may also be
        configured outside of the unit configuration file by adding a symlink to a
        .wants/ directory accompanying the unit file. For details, see above.</p>
<p>Units listed in this option will be started if the configuring unit is. However, if the listed
        units fail to start or cannot be added to the transaction, this has no impact on the validity of the
        transaction as a whole, and this unit will still be started. This is the recommended way to hook
        the start-up of one unit to the start-up of another unit.</p>
<p>Note that requirement dependencies do not influence the order in which services are started or
        stopped. This has to be configured independently with the <var>After=</var> or
        <var>Before=</var> options. If unit foo.service pulls in unit
        bar.service as configured with <var>Wants=</var> and no ordering is
        configured with <var>After=</var> or <var>Before=</var>, then both units will be
        started simultaneously and without any delay between them if foo.service is
        activated.</p>
