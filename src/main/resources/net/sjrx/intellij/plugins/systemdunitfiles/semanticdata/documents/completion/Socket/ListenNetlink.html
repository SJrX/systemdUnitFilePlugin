<p>Specifies a Netlink family to create a socket
        for to listen on. This expects a short string referring to the
        AF_NETLINK family name (such as
        <var>audit</var> or <var>kobject-uevent</var>)
        as argument, optionally suffixed by a whitespace followed by a
        multicast group integer. Behavior otherwise is very similar to
        the <var>ListenDatagram=</var> directive
        above.</p>
