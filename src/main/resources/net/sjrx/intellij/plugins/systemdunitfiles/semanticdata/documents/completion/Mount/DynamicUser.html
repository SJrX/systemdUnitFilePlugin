<p>Takes a boolean parameter. If set, a UNIX user and group pair is allocated
        dynamically when the unit is started, and released as soon as it is stopped. The user and group will
        not be added to /etc/passwd or /etc/group, but are managed
        transiently during runtime. The
        <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/nss-systemd.8.html">nss-systemd(8)
    </a> glibc
        NSS module provides integration of these dynamic users/groups into the system's user and group
        databases. The user and group name to use may be configured via <var>User=</var> and
        <var>Group=</var> (see above). If these options are not used and dynamic user/group
        allocation is enabled for a unit, the name of the dynamic user/group is implicitly derived from the
        unit name. If the unit name without the type suffix qualifies as valid user name it is used directly,
        otherwise a name incorporating a hash of it is used. If a statically allocated user or group of the
        configured name already exists, it is used and no dynamic user/group is allocated. Note that if
        <var>User=</var> is specified and the static group with the name exists, then it is required
        that the static user with the name already exists. Similarly, if <var>Group=</var> is
        specified and the static user with the name exists, then it is required that the static group with
        the name already exists. Dynamic users/groups are allocated from the UID/GID range 61184â€¦65519. It is
        recommended to avoid this range for regular system or login users. At any point in time each UID/GID
        from this range is only assigned to zero or one dynamically allocated users/groups in use. However,
        UID/GIDs are recycled after a unit is terminated. Care should be taken that any processes running as
        part of a unit for which dynamic users/groups are enabled do not leave files or directories owned by
        these users/groups around, as a different unit might get the same UID/GID assigned later on, and thus
        gain access to these files or directories. If <var>DynamicUser=</var> is enabled,
        <var>RemoveIPC=</var> and <var>PrivateTmp=</var> are implied (and cannot be turned
        off). This ensures that the lifetime of IPC objects and temporary files created by the executed
        processes is bound to the runtime of the service, and hence the lifetime of the dynamic
        user/group. Since /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ are usually the only
        world-writable directories on a system this ensures that a unit making use of dynamic user/group
        allocation cannot leave files around after unit termination. Furthermore
        <var>NoNewPrivileges=</var> and <var>RestrictSUIDSGID=</var> are implicitly enabled
        (and cannot be disabled), to ensure that processes invoked cannot take benefit or create SUID/SGID
        files or directories. Moreover <var>ProtectSystem=strict</var> and
        <var>ProtectHome=read-only</var> are implied, thus prohibiting the service to write to
        arbitrary file system locations. In order to allow the service to write to certain directories, they
        have to be allow-listed using <var>ReadWritePaths=</var>, but care must be taken so that
        UID/GID recycling doesn't create security issues involving files created by the service. Use
        <var>RuntimeDirectory=</var> (see below) in order to assign a writable runtime directory to a
        service, owned by the dynamic user/group and removed automatically when the unit is terminated. Use
        <var>StateDirectory=</var>, <var>CacheDirectory=</var> and
        <var>LogsDirectory=</var> in order to assign a set of writable directories for specific
        purposes to the service in a way that they are protected from vulnerabilities due to UID reuse (see
        below). If this option is enabled, care should be taken that the unit's processes do not get access
        to directories outside of these explicitly configured and managed ones. Specifically, do not use
        <var>BindPaths=</var> and be careful with AF_UNIX file descriptor
        passing for directory file descriptors, as this would permit processes to create files or directories
        owned by the dynamic user/group that are not subject to the lifecycle and access guarantees of the
        service. Defaults to off.</p>
